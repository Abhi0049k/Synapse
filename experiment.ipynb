       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'files/Token.txt'}, page_content='Understanding Tokens and How AI Models Determine Output Length\\nWhat is a Token?\\nIn the context of Large Language Models (LLMs), a token is the fundamental unit of text that the model processes. A common misconception is that one token equals one word, but this is not always the case.\\n\\nA token can be:\\n\\nA full word (e.g., \"apple\", \"run\")\\n\\nA part of a word (e.g., \"token\", \"iza\", \"tion\" for the word \"tokenization\")\\n\\nPunctuation (e.g., \".\", \"!\", \"?\")\\n\\nA space (e.g., \" \")\\n\\nA special marker (e.g., [CLS] for \"classification\" or [EOS] for \"end of sentence\")\\n\\nThe process of converting a plain text string (like \"Hello, world!\") into a sequence of tokens is called tokenization. Models use a specific \"tokenizer\" with a fixed vocabulary. This is why the word \"unbelievable\" might be split into \"un\", \"believe\", and \"able\". This approach allows the model to handle a vast vocabulary and even words it has never seen before by breaking them down into known sub-word parts.\\n\\nHow AI Models Generate Output\\nAn AI model like a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) is a generative model. This means it doesn\\'t plan its entire response in advance. Instead, it generates the output one token at a time.\\n\\nThe process works like this:\\n\\nInput: The model receives an input prompt (e.g., \"The capital of France is\").\\n\\nTokenization: The prompt is tokenized into a sequence of numbers, each representing a token.\\n\\nPrediction: The model analyzes the input tokens and predicts a probability distribution over its entire vocabulary for what the very next token should be. For our example, the token for \"Paris\" would receive a very high probability.\\n\\nSampling: The model selects the next token from this probability list. (This selection can be influenced by parameters like \"temperature\" and \"top_p\", which control the randomness).\\n\\nAppend and Repeat: The newly chosen token (\"Paris\") is appended to the input sequence. The model now treats \"The capital of France is Paris\" as its new input and repeats the process, predicting the next token (which might be a period \".\" or a newline character).\\n\\nThis \"predict-append-repeat\" loop continues, with the model generating one new token based on all the tokens that came before it.\\n\\nHow the Model \"Determines\" When to Stop\\nThis is the key to your question. The model doesn\\'t \"know\" it will generate 15 tokens or 100 tokens. It \"determines\" the output is finished when it decides to generate a special stop token.\\n\\nStop Tokens (or \"End-of-Sequence\" Tokens): During its training, the model learns from vast amounts of text. It learns that sentences and documents have an end. To represent this, a special token (often written as [EOS], [STOP], or <|endoftext|>) is included in its vocabulary.\\n\\nPredicting the Stop Token: In the \"predict-append-repeat\" loop, this special [EOS] token is always one of the possible tokens the model can choose. When the model determines, based on the context it has generated so far, that the thought is complete or the answer is finished, it will assign the highest probability to this [EOS] token.\\n\\nTermination: When the model generates the [EOS] token, the generation process stops. The model has \"decided\" that the output is complete. The final token count is simply the number of tokens it generated before it produced the stop token.\\n\\nExternal Control: The max_tokens Parameter\\nThere is a second, more direct way the output length is \"determined,\" but it is an external command, not a decision by the model itself.\\n\\nWhen you make a request to an AI model via an API or a user interface, you can almost always set a parameter like max_tokens or max_length.\\n\\nWhat it is: This is a hard limit you impose on the output. You are telling the model, \"Do not generate more than this many tokens, no matter what.\"\\n\\nHow it works: The model will continue its \"predict-append-repeat\" loop. If it generates the [EOS] stop token before hitting the max_tokens limit, the output will be complete and coherent.\\n\\nForced Cutoff: If the model reaches the max_tokens limit (e.g., 200 tokens) but has not yet generated a stop token, the generation is forcibly cut off. This often results in an incomplete sentence or a thought that is cut off mid-stream.\\n\\nIn summary: The AI model itself determines the end of its output by predicting a special stop token. The user or developer controls the maximum possible length by setting a max_tokens parameter to prevent runaway generation and manage costs.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'files/Ray Tracing.txt'}, page_content='The Principles and Applications of Ray Tracing\\nWhat is Ray Tracing?\\nRay tracing is a sophisticated rendering technique used in 3D computer graphics to generate photorealistic images. It works by simulating the physical behavior of light. Unlike other rendering methods, such as rasterization, which projects 3D objects onto a 2D screen, ray tracing follows the path of light \"in reverse.\"\\n\\nInstead of simulating infinite rays of light emanating from a light source (which would be computationally impossible), ray tracing traces rays from the camera\\'s viewpoint, through each pixel on the screen, and out into the 3D scene. The color of each pixel is then determined by the objects and light sources that this \"view ray\" interacts with.\\n\\nHow Does Ray Tracing Work? The Core Algorithm\\nThe ray tracing algorithm can be broken down into several key steps for each pixel in the final image:\\n\\n1. Primary Ray Generation (Ray Casting): The process begins at the virtual camera or \"eye.\" For every pixel on the 2D image plane (the \"screen\"), a primary ray is cast from the camera\\'s position, through that pixel\\'s center, and into the 3D scene.\\n\\n2. Ray-Object Intersection: The algorithm then calculates if this primary ray intersects with any objects (like spheres, polygons, or triangles) in the scene. It finds the closest intersection point to the camera. If the ray does not hit any object, the pixel is typically colored with a background color or environment map.\\n\\n3. Shading and Illumination: If the ray hits an object, the color of that object at the intersection point must be calculated. This is where the simulation becomes recursive and powerful. To determine the color, new rays are generated from the intersection point:\\n\\nShadow Rays: A ray is cast from the intersection point toward each light source in the scene. If this \"shadow ray\" hits another object before it reaches the light source, it means the point is in shadow, and the light from that source does not contribute to its color. If the ray reaches the light source unobstructed, the light\\'s contribution (color, intensity, and angle) is factored into the pixel\\'s final color.\\n\\nReflection Rays: If the object\\'s material is reflective (like a mirror or polished metal), a new reflection ray is generated. This ray bounces off the surface at an angle equal to the angle of incidence, following the law of reflection. The algorithm then recursively traces this new ray to see what it hits. The color returned from the reflection ray is blended with the object\\'s own color.\\n\\nRefraction (Transparency) Rays: If the object\\'s material is transparent or translucent (like glass or water), a new refraction ray is generated. This ray passes through the object, bending according to Snell\\'s law, which describes the change in direction based on the material\\'s refractive index. This ray is also traced recursively to see what is visible through the object.\\n\\n4. Recursive Combination: The final color of the pixel is a combination of the object\\'s inherent color (its \"local\" illumination from light sources) and the colors gathered from its reflection and refraction rays. This recursive process can continue for a set number of \"bounces\" to simulate complex light paths, such as seeing a reflection of a reflection.\\n\\nKey Advantages of Ray Tracing\\nThe primary advantage of ray tracing is its photorealism. Because it simulates the physics of light, it can naturally and accurately produce a wide range of complex visual effects that are very difficult or impossible to achieve with other methods like rasterization.\\n\\nThese effects include:\\n\\nAccurate, Hard and Soft Shadows: Shadows are a natural byproduct of shadow rays being blocked, and they can be \"soft\" if the light source is an area rather than a single point.\\n\\nRealistic Reflections: Surfaces can show perfect mirror-like reflections or blurred/glossy reflections based on material properties.\\n\\nTrue Refraction: The bending of light as it passes through transparent objects like glass and water is simulated correctly, leading to realistic distortion effects.\\n\\nGlobal Illumination: Advanced forms of ray tracing, like path tracing, can simulate global illumination. This is where light bounces off all surfaces, not just from direct light sources. For example, sunlight hitting a red wall will cast a faint red glow onto an adjacent white ceiling.\\n\\nDisadvantages and Challenges\\nThe main drawback of ray tracing has historically been its computational cost. Tracing millions of rays (one for each pixel) and then recursively tracing shadow, reflection, and refraction rays for multiple bounces is extremely demanding on the CPU or GPU.\\n\\nFor decades, this cost restricted ray tracing to non-real-time applications, such as in visual effects (VFX) for movies and architectural visualization, where a single frame could take minutes or even hours to render.\\n\\nHowever, the advent of specialized hardware (like NVIDIA\\'s RTX GPUs with \"RT Cores\" and similar technologies from AMD and Apple) has made real-time ray tracing possible. This technology is now a major feature in modern video games, blending ray tracing with traditional rasterization to achieve realistic lighting and reflections without sacrificing performance.\\n\\nCommon Applications\\nRay tracing is used in any field that requires the highest degree of visual fidelity:\\n\\nFilm and Television (VFX): Used to create lifelike computer-generated imagery (CGI) and special effects that blend seamlessly with live-action footage.\\n\\nVideo Games: Used for realistic in-game lighting, shadows, and reflections to create more immersive environments.\\n\\nArchitecture and Product Design: Used to create photorealistic visualizations of buildings and products before they are built, allowing designers and clients to see exactly how they will look.\\n\\nScientific and Medical Visualization: Used to render complex 3D data from sources like CT or MRI scans.')]"

Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsigniﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional\\ncomputation [26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 16]. In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 11]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,x n) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1,...,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1,...,y m) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers.

While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneﬁcial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the ﬁnal values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = ∑dk\\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\\n4'),\n",

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h= 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[31, 2, 8].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0,xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\n5'),\n",

We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1,...,x n) to another sequence of equal length (z1,...,z n), with xi,zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[31] and byte-pair [25] representations.

Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 15], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network.

Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [17] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate= d−0.5\\nmodel ·min(step_num−0.5,step_num·warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the ﬁrst warmup_stepstraining steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps= 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [27] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized.

But now that there are com-\\nputers, there are even more algorithms, and algorithms lie at the heart of computing.\\nThis book provides a comprehensive introduction to the modern study of com-\\nputer algorithms. It presents many algorithms and covers them in considerable\\ndepth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. We\\nhave tried to keep explanations elementary without sacriﬁcing depth of coverage\\nor mathematical rigor.\\nEach chapter presents an algorithm, a design technique, an application area, or a\\nrelated topic. Algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to\\nbe readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The book contains 244\\nﬁgures—many with multiple parts—illustrating how the algorithms work. Since\\nwe emphasizeefﬁciency as a design criterion, we include careful analyses of the\\nrunning times of all our algorithms.\\nThe text is intended primarily for use in undergraduate or graduate courses in\\nalgorithms or data structures. Because it discusses engineering issues in algorithm\\ndesign, as well as mathematical aspects, it is equally well suited for self-study by\\ntechnical professionals.\\nIn this, the third edition, we have once again updated the entire book. The\\nchanges cover a broad spectrum, including new chapters, revised pseudocode, and\\na more active writing style.\\nTotheteacher\\nWe have designed this book to be both versatile and complete. You should ﬁnd it\\nuseful for a variety of courses, from an undergraduate course in data structures up\\nthrough a graduate course in algorithms. Because we have provided considerably\\nmore material than can ﬁt in a typical one-term course, you can consider this book\\nto be a “buffet” or “smorgasbord” from which you can pick and choose the material\\nthat best supports the course you wish to teach.'),\n",

We have made chapters relatively self-contained, so that you need not worry\\nabout an unexpected and unnecessary dependence of one chapter on another. Each\\nchapter presents the easier material ﬁrst and the more difﬁcult material later, with\\nsection boundaries marking natural stopping points. In an undergraduate course,\\nyou might use only the earlier sections from a chapter; in a graduate course, you\\nmight cover the entire chapter.\\nWe have included 957 exercises and 158 problems. Each section ends with exer-\\ncises, and each chapter ends with problems. The exercises are generally short ques-\\ntions that test basic mastery of the material. Some are simple self-check thought\\nexercises, whereas others are more substantial and are suitable as assigned home-\\nwork. The problems are more elaborate case studies that often introduce new ma-\\nterial; they often consist of several questions that lead the student through the steps\\nrequired to arrive at a solution.\\nDeparting from our practice in previous editions of this book, we have made\\npublicly available solutions to some, but by no means all, of the problems and ex-\\nercises. Our Web site, http://mitpress.mit.edu/algorithms/, links to these solutions.\\nYou will want to check this site to make sure that it does not contain the solution to\\nan exercise or problem that you plan to assign. We expect the set of solutions that\\nwe post to grow slowly over time, so you will need to check it each time you teach\\nthe course.\\nWe have starred (?) the sections and exercises that are more suitable for graduate\\nstudents than for undergraduates. A starred section is not necessarily more difﬁ-\\ncult than an unstarred one, but it may require an understanding of more advanced\\nmathematics. Likewise, starred exercises may require an advanced background or\\nmore than average creativity.\\nTothestudent\\nWe hope that this textbook provides you with an enjoyable introduction to the\\nﬁeld of algorithms. We have attempted to make every algorithm accessible and\\ninteresting. To help you when you encounter unfamiliar or difﬁcult algorithms, we\\ndescribe each one in a step-by-step manner. We also provide careful explanations\\nof the mathematics needed to understand the analysis of the algorithms. If you\\nalready have some familiarity with a topic, you will ﬁnd the chapters organized so\\nthat you can skim introductory sections and proceed quickly to the more advanced\\nmaterial.\\nThis is a large book, and your class will probably cover only a portion of its\\nmaterial. We have tried, however, to make this a book that will be useful to you\\nnow as a course textbook and also later in your career as a mathematical desk\\nreference or an engineering handbook.'),\n",

The mag-\\nnitude of the changes is on a par with the changes between the ﬁrst and second\\neditions. As we said about the second-edition changes, depending on how you\\nlook at it, the book changed either not much or quite a bit.\\nA quick look at the table of contents shows that most of the second-edition chap-\\nters and sections appear in the third edition. We removed two chapters and one\\nsection, but we have added three new chapters and two new sections apart from\\nthese new chapters.\\nWe kept the hybrid organization from the ﬁrst two editions. Rather than organiz-\\ning chapters by only problem domains or according only to techniques, this book\\nhas elements of both. It contains technique-based chapters on divide-and-conquer,\\ndynamic programming, greedy algorithms, amortized analysis, NP-Completeness,\\nand approximation algorithms. But it also has entire parts on sorting, on data\\nstructures for dynamic sets, and on algorithms for graph problems. We ﬁnd that\\nalthough you need to know how to apply techniques for designing and analyzing al-\\ngorithms, problems seldom announce to you which techniques are most amenable\\nto solving them.\\nHere is a summary of the most signiﬁcant changes for the third edition:\\n\\x0f We added new chapters on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms,\\nand we have broken out material on matrix basics into its own appendix chapter.\\n\\x0f We revised the chapter on recurrences to more broadly cover the divide-and-\\nconquer technique, and its ﬁrst two sections apply divide-and-conquer to solve\\ntwo problems. The second section of this chapter presents Strassen’s algorithm\\nfor matrix multiplication, which we have moved from the chapter on matrix\\noperations.\\n\\x0f We removed two chapters that were rarely taught: binomial heaps and sorting\\nnetworks. One key idea in the sorting networks chapter, the 0-1 principle, ap-\\npears in this edition within Problem 8-7 as the 0-1 sorting lemma for compare-\\nexchange algorithms. The treatment of Fibonacci heaps no longer relies on\\nbinomial heaps as a precursor.'),\n",

Dy-\\nnamic programming now leads off with a more interesting problem, rod cutting,\\nthan the assembly-line scheduling problem from the second edition. Further-\\nmore, we emphasize memoization a bit more than we did in the second edition,\\nand we introduce the notion of the subproblem graph as a way to understand\\nthe running time of a dynamic-programming algorithm. In our opening exam-\\nple of greedy algorithms, the activity-selection problem, we get to the greedy\\nalgorithm more directly than we did in the second edition.\\n\\x0f The way we delete a node from binary search trees (which includes red-black\\ntrees) now guarantees that the node requested for deletion is the node that is\\nactually deleted. In the ﬁrst two editions, in certain cases, some other node\\nwould be deleted, with its contents moving into the node passed to the deletion\\nprocedure. With our new way to delete nodes, if other components of a program\\nmaintain pointers to nodes in the tree, they will not mistakenly end up with stale\\npointers to nodes that have been deleted.\\n\\x0f The material on ﬂow networks now bases ﬂows entirely on edges. This ap-\\nproach is more intuitive than the net ﬂow used in the ﬁrst two editions.\\n\\x0f With the material on matrix basics and Strassen’s algorithm moved to other\\nchapters, the chapter on matrix operations is smaller than in the second edition.\\n\\x0f We have modiﬁed our treatment of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt string-matching al-\\ngorithm.\\n\\x0f We corrected several errors. Most of these errors were posted on our Web site\\nof second-edition errata, but a few were not.\\n\\x0f Based on many requests, we changed the syntax (as it were) of our pseudocode.\\nWe now use “D” to indicate assignment and “= =” to test for equality, just as C,\\nC++, Java, and Python do. Likewise, we have eliminated the keywordsdoand\\nthenand adopted “/ /” as our comment-to-end-of-line symbol. We also now use\\ndot-notation to indicate object attributes. Our pseudocode remains procedural,\\nrather than object-oriented. In other words, rather than running methods on\\nobjects, we simply call procedures, passing objects as parameters.\\n\\x0f We added 100 new exercises and 28 new problems. We also updated many\\nbibliography entries and added several new ones.\\n\\x0f Finally, we went through the entire book and rewrote sentences, paragraphs,\\nand sections to make the writing clearer and more active.'),\n",

It is\\nintended to be a gentle introduction to how we specify algorithms, some of the\\ndesign strategies we will use throughout this book, and many of the fundamental\\nideas used in algorithm analysis. Later parts of this book will build upon this base.\\nChapter 1 provides an overview of algorithms and their place in modern com-\\nputing systems. This chapter deﬁnes what an algorithm is and lists some examples.\\nIt also makes a case that we should consider algorithms as a technology, along-\\nside technologies such as fast hardware, graphical user interfaces, object-oriented\\nsystems, and networks.\\nIn Chapter 2, we see our ﬁrst algorithms, which solve the problem of sorting\\na sequence ofn numbers. They are written in a pseudocode which, although not\\ndirectly translatable to any conventional programming language, conveys the struc-\\nture of the algorithm clearly enough that you should be able to implement it in the\\nlanguage of your choice. The sorting algorithms we examine are insertion sort,\\nwhich uses an incremental approach, and merge sort, which uses a recursive tech-\\nnique known as “divide-and-conquer.” Although the time each requires increases\\nwith the value ofn, the rate of increase differs between the two algorithms. We\\ndetermine these running times in Chapter 2, and we develop a useful notation to\\nexpress them.\\nChapter 3 precisely deﬁnes this notation, which we call asymptotic notation. It\\nstarts by deﬁning several asymptotic notations, which we use for bounding algo-\\nrithm running times from above and/or below. The rest of Chapter 3 is primarily\\na presentation of mathematical notation, more to ensure that your use of notation\\nmatches that in this book than to teach you new mathematical concepts.'),\n",

It provides additional examples of divide-and-conquer algorithms, in-\\ncluding Strassen’s surprising method for multiplying two square matrices. Chap-\\nter 4 contains methods for solving recurrences, which are useful for describing\\nthe running times of recursive algorithms. One powerful technique is the “mas-\\nter method,” which we often use to solve recurrences that arise from divide-and-\\nconquer algorithms. Although much of Chapter 4 is devoted to proving the cor-\\nrectness of the master method, you may skip this proof yet still employ the master\\nmethod.\\nChapter 5 introduces probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms. We typ-\\nically use probabilistic analysis to determine the running time of an algorithm in\\ncases in which, due to the presence of an inherent probability distribution, the\\nrunning time may differ on different inputs of the same size. In some cases, we\\nassume that the inputs conform to a known probability distribution, so that we are\\naveraging the running time over all possible inputs. In other cases, the probability\\ndistribution comes not from the inputs but from random choices made during the\\ncourse of the algorithm.

Why is the study of algorithms worthwhile? What is the role\\nof algorithms relative to other technologies used in computers? In this chapter, we\\nwill answer these questions.\\n1.1 Algorithms\\nInformally, analgorithm is any well-deﬁned computational procedure that takes\\nsome value, or set of values, asinputand produces some value, or set of values, as\\noutput. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the\\ninput into the output.\\nWe can also view an algorithm as a tool for solving a well-speciﬁedcomputa-\\ntionalproblem. The statement of the problem speciﬁes in general terms the desired\\ninput/output relationship. The algorithm describes a speciﬁc computational proce-\\ndure for achieving that input/output relationship.\\nFor example, we might need to sort a sequence of numbers into nondecreasing\\norder. This problem arises frequently in practice and provides fertile ground for\\nintroducing many standard design techniques and analysis tools. Here is how we\\nformally deﬁne thesortingproblem:\\nInput: A sequence ofn numbers ha1; a 2 ; : : : ; a n i.\\nOutput: A permutation (reordering)ha0\\n1; a 0\\n2; : : : ; a 0\\nn iof the input sequence such\\nthat a0\\n1 \\x14a0\\n2 \\x14\\x01\\x01\\x01\\x14 a0\\nn.\\nFor example, given the input sequenceh31; 41; 59; 26; 41; 58 i, a sorting algorithm\\nreturns as output the sequenceh26; 31; 41; 41; 58; 59 i. Such an input sequence is\\ncalled aninstance of the sorting problem. In general, aninstance of a problem\\nconsists of the input (satisfying whatever constraints are imposed in the problem\\nstatement) needed to compute a solution to the problem.'),\n",

As a result, we have a large number of good sorting\\nalgorithms at our disposal. Which algorithm is best for a given application depends\\non—among other factors—the number of items to be sorted, the extent to which\\nthe items are already somewhat sorted, possible restrictions on the item values,\\nthe architecture of the computer, and the kind of storage devices to be used: main\\nmemory, disks, or even tapes.\\nAn algorithm is said to becorrect if, for every input instance, it halts with the\\ncorrect output. We say that a correct algorithmsolves the given computational\\nproblem. An incorrect algorithm might not halt at all on some input instances, or it\\nmight halt with an incorrect answer. Contrary to what you might expect, incorrect\\nalgorithms can sometimes be useful, if we can control their error rate. We shall see\\nan example of an algorithm with a controllable error rate in Chapter 31 when we\\nstudy algorithms for ﬁnding large prime numbers. Ordinarily, however, we shall\\nbe concerned only with correct algorithms.\\nAn algorithm can be speciﬁed in English, as a computer program, or even as\\na hardware design. The only requirement is that the speciﬁcation must provide a\\nprecise description of the computational procedure to be followed.\\nWhatkindsofproblemsare solvedbyalgorithms?\\nSorting is by no means the only computational problem for which algorithms have\\nbeen developed. (You probably suspected as much when you saw the size of this\\nbook.) Practical applications of algorithms are ubiquitous and include the follow-\\ning examples:\\n\\x0f The Human Genome Project has made great progress toward the goals of iden-\\ntifying all the 100,000 genes in human DNA, determining the sequences of the\\n3 billion chemical base pairs that make up human DNA, storing this informa-\\ntion in databases, and developing tools for data analysis. Each of these steps\\nrequires sophisticated algorithms. Although the solutions to the various prob-\\nlems involved are beyond the scope of this book, many methods to solve these\\nbiological problems use ideas from several of the chapters in this book, thereby\\nenabling scientists to accomplish tasks while using resources efﬁciently. The\\nsavings are in time, both human and machine, and in money, as more informa-\\ntion can be extracted from laboratory techniques.\\n\\x0f The Internet enables people all around the world to quickly access and retrieve\\nlarge amounts of information. With the aid of clever algorithms, sites on the\\nInternet are able to manage and manipulate this large volume of data. Examples\\nof problems that make essential use of algorithms include ﬁnding good routes\\non which the data will travel (techniques for solving such problems appear in'),\n",

The core\\ntechnologies used in electronic commerce include public-key cryptography and\\ndigital signatures (covered in Chapter 31), which are based on numerical algo-\\nrithms and number theory.\\n\\x0f Manufacturing and other commercial enterprises often need to allocate scarce\\nresources in the most beneﬁcial way. An oil company may wish to know where\\nto place its wells in order to maximize its expected proﬁt. A political candidate\\nmay want to determine where to spend money buying campaign advertising in\\norder to maximize the chances of winning an election.

All of\\nthese are examples of problems that can be solved using linear programming,\\nwhich we shall study in Chapter 29.\\nAlthough some of the details of these examples are beyond the scope of this\\nbook, we do give underlying techniques that apply to these problems and problem\\nareas. We also show how to solve many speciﬁc problems, including the following:\\n\\x0f We are given a road map on which the distance between each pair of adjacent\\nintersections is marked, and we wish to determine the shortest route from one\\nintersection to another. The number of possible routes can be huge, even if we\\ndisallow routes that cross over themselves. How do we choose which of all\\npossible routes is the shortest? Here, we model the road map (which is itself\\na model of the actual roads) as a graph (which we will meet in Part VI and\\nAppendix B), and we wish to ﬁnd the shortest path from one vertex to another\\nin the graph. We shall see how to solve this problem efﬁciently in Chapter 24.\\n\\x0f We are given two ordered sequences of symbols,X Dhx1; x 2; : : : ; x m iand\\nY Dhy1; y 2; : : : ; y n i, and we wish to ﬁnd a longest common subsequence of\\nX and Y .

The length of a longest common subsequence ofX\\nand Y gives one measure of how similar these two sequences are.

Selecting all possible subsequences ofX and Y and matching\\nthem up could take a prohibitively long time unlessm and n are very small.\\nWe shall see in Chapter 15 how to use a general technique known as dynamic\\nprogramming to solve this problem much more efﬁciently.\\n\\x0f We are given a mechanical design in terms of a library of parts, where each part\\nmay include instances of other parts, and we need to list the parts in order so\\nthat each part appears before any part that uses it. If the design comprisesn\\nparts, then there arenŠ possible orders, wherenŠ denotes the factorial function.\\nBecause the factorial function grows faster than even an exponential function,\\nwe cannot feasibly generate each possible order and then verify that, within\\nthat order, each part appears before the parts using it (unless we have only a\\nfew parts). This problem is an instance of topological sorting, and we shall see\\nin Chapter 22 how to solve this problem efﬁciently.\\n\\x0f We are givenn points in the plane, and we wish to ﬁnd the convex hull of\\nthese points. The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon containing the\\npoints. Intuitively, we can think of each point as being represented by a nail\\nsticking out from a board. The convex hull would be represented by a tight\\nrubber band that surrounds all the nails. Each nail around which the rubber\\nband makes a turn is a vertex of the convex hull. (See Figure 33.6 on page 1029\\nfor an example.) Any of the2n subsets of the points might be the vertices\\nof the convex hull. Knowing which points are vertices of the convex hull is\\nnot quite enough, either, since we also need to know the order in which they\\nappear. There are many choices, therefore, for the vertices of the convex hull.\\nChapter 33 gives two good methods for ﬁnding the convex hull.\\nThese lists are far from exhaustive (as you again have probably surmised from\\nthis book’s heft), but exhibit two characteristics that are common to many interest-\\ning algorithmic problems:\\n1. They have many candidate solutions, the overwhelming majority of which do\\nnot solve the problem at hand. Finding one that does, or one that is “best,” can\\npresent quite a challenge.\\n2. They have practical applications. Of the problems in the above list, ﬁnding the\\nshortest path provides the easiest examples. A transportation ﬁrm, such as a\\ntrucking or railroad company, has a ﬁnancial interest in ﬁnding shortest paths\\nthrough a road or rail network because taking shorter paths results in lower\\nlabor and fuel costs. Or a routing node on the Internet may need to ﬁnd the\\nshortest path through the network in order to route a message quickly. Or a\\nperson wishing to drive from New York to Boston may want to ﬁnd driving\\ndirections from an appropriate Web site, or she may use her GPS while driving.'),\n",

Second, the\\nset of NP-complete problems has the remarkable property that if an efﬁcient algo-\\nrithm exists for any one of them, then efﬁcient algorithms exist for all of them. This\\nrelationship among the NP-complete problems makes the lack of efﬁcient solutions\\nall the more tantalizing. Third, several NP-complete problems are similar, but not\\nidentical, to problems for which we do know of efﬁcient algorithms.

If you are called upon to produce an efﬁcient\\nalgorithm for an NP-complete problem, you are likely to spend a lot of time in a\\nfruitless search. If you can show that the problem is NP-complete, you can instead\\nspend your time developing an efﬁcient algorithm that gives a good, but not the\\nbest possible, solution.\\nAs a concrete example, consider a delivery company with a central depot. Each\\nday, it loads up each delivery truck at the depot and sends it around to deliver goods\\nto several addresses. At the end of the day, each truck must end up back at the depot\\nso that it is ready to be loaded for the next day.

Physical limitations present a fundamental roadblock to ever-increasing clock\\nspeeds, however: because power density increases superlinearly with clock speed,\\nchips run the risk of melting once their clock speeds become high enough. In order\\nto perform more computations per second, therefore, chips are being designed to\\ncontain not just one but several processing “cores.” We can liken these multicore\\ncomputers to several sequential computers on a single chip; in other words, they are\\na type of “parallel computer.” In order to elicit the best performance from multicore\\ncomputers, we need to design algorithms with parallelism in mind.

These differences can be much more signiﬁcant than differences\\ndue to hardware and software.\\nAs an example, in Chapter 2, we will see two algorithms for sorting. The ﬁrst,\\nknown asinsertionsort, takes time roughly equal toc1n2 to sortn items, wherec1\\nis a constant that does not depend onn. That is, it takes time roughly proportional\\nto n2. The second, merge sort, takes time roughly equal toc2n lg n, where lgn\\nstands for log2 n and c2 is another constant that also does not depend onn. Inser-\\ntion sort typically has a smaller constant factor than merge sort, so thatc1 < c 2.\\nWe shall see that the constant factors can have far less of an impact on the running\\ntime than the dependence on the input sizen. Let’s write insertion sort’s running\\ntime asc1n \\x01n and merge sort’s running time asc2n \\x01lg n. Then we see that where\\ninsertion sort has a factor ofn in its running time, merge sort has a factor of lgn,\\nwhich is much smaller. (For example, whenn D1000, lgn is approximately10,\\nand whenn equals one million, lgn is approximately only20.) Although insertion\\nsort usually runs faster than merge sort for small input sizes, once the input sizen\\nbecomes large enough, merge sort’s advantage of lgn vs. n will more than com-\\npensate for the difference in constant factors. No matter how much smallerc1 is\\nthan c2, there will always be a crossover point beyond which merge sort is faster.\\nFor a concrete example, let us pit a faster computer (computer A) running inser-\\ntion sort against a slower computer (computer B) running merge sort. They each\\nmust sort an array of 10 million numbers. (Although 10 million numbers might\\nseem like a lot, if the numbers are eight-byte integers, then the input occupies\\nabout 80 megabytes, which ﬁts in the memory of even an inexpensive laptop com-\\nputer many times over.) Suppose that computer A executes 10 billion instructions\\nper second (faster than any single sequential computer at the time of this writing)\\nand computer B executes only 10 million instructions per second, so that com-\\nputer A is 1000 times faster than computer B in raw computing power. To make\\nthe difference even more dramatic, suppose that the world’s craftiest programmer\\ncodes insertion sort in machine language for computer A, and the resulting code\\nrequires 2n2 instructions to sortn numbers. Suppose further that just an average\\nprogrammer implements merge sort, using a high-level language with an inefﬁcient\\ncompiler, with the resulting code taking50n lg n instructions. To sort 10 million\\nnumbers, computer A takes\\n2 \\x01.107 /2 instructions\\n1010 instructions/second D20,000 seconds (more than 5.5 hours);\\nwhile computer B takes'),\n",

It is self-contained, but\\nit does include several references to material that we introduce in Chapters 3 and 4.\\n(It also contains several summations, which Appendix A shows how to solve.)\\nWe begin by examining the insertion sort algorithm to solve the sorting problem\\nintroduced in Chapter 1. We deﬁne a “pseudocode” that should be familiar to you if\\nyou have done computer programming, and we use it to show how we shall specify\\nour algorithms. Having speciﬁed the insertion sort algorithm, we then argue that it\\ncorrectly sorts, and we analyze its running time. The analysis introduces a notation\\nthat focuses on how that time increases with the number of items to be sorted.\\nFollowing our discussion of insertion sort, we introduce the divide-and-conquer\\napproach to the design of algorithms and use it to develop an algorithm called\\nmerge sort. We end with an analysis of merge sort’s running time.\\n2.1 Insertionsort\\nOur ﬁrst algorithm, insertion sort, solves thesorting problemintroduced in Chap-\\nter 1:\\nInput: A sequence ofn numbers ha1; a 2; : : : ; a n i.\\nOutput: A permutation (reordering)ha0\\n1; a 0\\n2; : : : ; a 0\\nniof the input sequence such\\nthat a0\\n1 \\x14a0\\n2 \\x14\\x01\\x01\\x01\\x14 a0\\nn .\\nThe numbers that we wish to sort are also known as thekeys.

What separates pseudocode from “real” code is that in\\npseudocode, we employ whatever expressive method is most clear and concise to\\nspecify a given algorithm. Sometimes, the clearest method is English, so do not\\nbe surprised if you come across an English phrase or sentence embedded within\\na section of “real” code. Another difference between pseudocode and real code\\nis that pseudocode is not typically concerned with issues of software engineering.\\nIssues of data abstraction, modularity, and error handling are often ignored in order\\nto convey the essence of the algorithm more concisely.\\nWe start withinsertion sort, which is an efﬁcient algorithm for sorting a small\\nnumber of elements. Insertion sort works the way many people sort a hand of\\nplaying cards. We start with an empty left hand and the cards face down on the\\ntable. We then remove one card at a time from the table and insert it into the\\ncorrect position in the left hand. To ﬁnd the correct position for a card, we compare\\nit with each of the cards already in the hand, from right to left, as illustrated in\\nFigure 2.1. At all times, the cards held in the left hand are sorted, and these cards\\nwere originally the top cards of the pile on the table.\\nWe present our pseudocode for insertion sort as a procedure called INSERTION -\\nSORT, which takes as a parameter an arrayAŒ1 : : n\\x8d containing a sequence of\\nlength n that is to be sorted. (In the code, the numbern of elements inA is denoted\\nby A: length.) The algorithm sorts the input numbersin place: it rearranges the\\nnumbers within the arrayA, with at most a constant number of them stored outside\\nthe array at any time. The input arrayA contains the sorted output sequence when\\nthe INSERTION -SORT procedure is ﬁnished.'),\n",

(Of course, we are free to use established facts other than the loop\\ninvariant itself to prove that the loop invariant remains true before each iteration.)\\nNote the similarity to mathematical induction, where to prove that a property holds,\\nyou prove a base case and an inductive step. Here, showing that the invariant holds\\nbefore the ﬁrst iteration corresponds to the base case, and showing that the invariant\\nholds from iteration to iteration corresponds to the inductive step.\\nThe third property is perhaps the most important one, since we are using the loop\\ninvariant to show correctness. Typically, we use the loop invariant along with the\\ncondition that caused the loop to terminate. The termination property differs from\\nhow we usually use mathematical induction, in which we apply the inductive step\\ninﬁnitely; here, we stop the “induction” when the loop terminates.\\nLet us see how these properties hold for insertion sort.\\nInitialization: We start by showing that the loop invariant holds before the ﬁrst\\nloop iteration, whenj D2.1 The subarrayAŒ1 : : j /NUL 1\\x8d, therefore, consists\\nof just the single elementAŒ1\\x8d, which is in fact the original element inAŒ1\\x8d.\\nMoreover, this subarray is sorted (trivially, of course), which shows that the\\nloop invariant holds prior to the ﬁrst iteration of the loop.\\nMaintenance: Next, we tackle the second property: showing that each iteration\\nmaintains the loop invariant. Informally, the body of thefor loop works by\\nmoving AŒj /NUL 1\\x8d, AŒj /NUL 2\\x8d, AŒj /NUL 3\\x8d, and so on by one position to the right\\nuntil it ﬁnds the proper position forAŒj \\x8d (lines 4–7), at which point it inserts\\nthe value ofAŒj \\x8d (line 8). The subarrayAŒ1 : : j \\x8d then consists of the elements\\noriginally inAŒ1 : : j \\x8d , but in sorted order. Incrementingj for the next iteration\\nof theforloop then preserves the loop invariant.\\nA more formal treatment of the second property would require us to state and\\nshow a loop invariant for thewhile loop of lines 5–7. At this point, however,\\n1When the loop is aforloop, the moment at which we check the loop invariant just prior to the ﬁrst\\niteration is immediately after the initial assignment to the loop-counter variable and just before the\\nﬁrst test in the loop header.

The\\ncondition causing theforloop to terminate is thatj > A: length Dn. Because\\neach loop iteration increasesj by 1, we must havej Dn C1 at that time.\\nSubstituting n C1 for j in the wording of loop invariant, we have that the\\nsubarray AŒ1 : : n\\x8d consists of the elements originally inAŒ1 : : n\\x8d , but in sorted\\norder. Observing that the subarrayAŒ1 : : n\\x8d is the entire array, we conclude that\\nthe entire array is sorted. Hence, the algorithm is correct.\\nWe shall use this method of loop invariants to show correctness later in this\\nchapter and in other chapters as well.\\nPseudocodeconventions\\nWe use the following conventions in our pseudocode.\\n\\x0f Indentation indicates block structure. For example, the body of theforloop that\\nbegins on line 1 consists of lines 2–8, and the body of thewhileloop that begins\\non line 5 contains lines 6–7 but not line 8. Our indentation style applies to\\nif-elsestatements2 as well. Using indentation instead of conventional indicators\\nof block structure, such asbegin and end statements, greatly reduces clutter\\nwhile preserving, or even enhancing, clarity.3\\n\\x0f The looping constructswhile, for, andrepeat-until and theif-elseconditional\\nconstruct have interpretations similar to those in C, C++, Java, Python, and\\nPascal.4 In this book, the loop counter retains its value after exiting the loop,\\nunlike some situations that arise in C++, Java, and Pascal. Thus, immediately\\nafter aforloop, the loop counter’s value is the value that ﬁrst exceeded thefor\\nloop bound. We used this property in our correctness argument for insertion\\nsort. The for loop header in line 1 isfor j D 2 to A: length, and so when\\nthis loop terminates,j DA: length C1 (or, equivalently,j Dn C1, since\\nn DA: length). We use the keywordto when a for loop increments its loop\\n2In an if-else statement, we indentelse at the same level as its matchingif. Although we omit the\\nkeyword then, we occasionally refer to the portion executed when the test followingif is true as a\\nthenclause. For multiway tests, we useelseiffor tests after the ﬁrst one.\\n3Each pseudocode procedure in this book appears on one page so that you will not have to discern\\nlevels of indentation in code that is split across pages.\\n4Most block-structured languages have equivalent constructs, though the exact syntax may differ.\\nPython lacksrepeat-until loops, and itsfor loops operate a little differently from thefor loops in\\nthis book.'),\n",

State the problem formally and write pseudocode for\\nadding the two integers.\\n2.2 Analyzingalgorithms\\nAnalyzing an algorithm has come to mean predicting the resources that the algo-\\nrithm requires. Occasionally, resources such as memory, communication band-\\nwidth, or computer hardware are of primary concern, but most often it is compu-\\ntational time that we want to measure. Generally, by analyzing several candidate\\nalgorithms for a problem, we can identify a most efﬁcient one. Such analysis may\\nindicate more than one viable candidate, but we can often discard several inferior\\nalgorithms in the process.\\nBefore we can analyze an algorithm, we must have a model of the implemen-\\ntation technology that we will use, including a model for the resources of that\\ntechnology and their costs. For most of this book, we shall assume a generic one-\\nprocessor, random-access machine (RAM)model of computation as our imple-\\nmentation technology and understand that our algorithms will be implemented as\\ncomputer programs. In the RAM model, instructions are executed one after an-\\nother, with no concurrent operations.\\nStrictly speaking, we should precisely deﬁne the instructions of the RAM model\\nand their costs. To do so, however, would be tedious and would yield little insight\\ninto algorithm design and analysis. Yet we must be careful not to abuse the RAM\\nmodel. For example, what if a RAM had an instruction that sorts? Then we could\\nsort in just one instruction. Such a RAM would be unrealistic, since real computers\\ndo not have such instructions. Our guide, therefore, is how real computers are de-\\nsigned. The RAM model contains instructions commonly found in real computers:\\narithmetic (such as add, subtract, multiply, divide, remainder, ﬂoor, ceiling), data\\nmovement (load, store, copy), and control (conditional and unconditional branch,\\nsubroutine call and return). Each such instruction takes a constant amount of time.\\nThe data types in the RAM model are integer and ﬂoating point (for storing real\\nnumbers). Although we typically do not concern ourselves with precision in this\\nbook, in some applications precision is crucial. We also assume a limit on the size\\nof each word of data. For example, when working with inputs of sizen, we typ-\\nically assume that integers are represented byc lg n bits for some constantc \\x151.\\nWe requirec \\x151 so that each word can hold the value ofn, enabling us to index the\\nindividual input elements, and we restrictc to be a constant so that the word size\\ndoes not grow arbitrarily. (If the word size could grow arbitrarily, we could store\\nhuge amounts of data in one word and operate on it all in constant time—clearly\\nan unrealistic scenario.)'),\n",

For example, is exponentiation a constant-\\ntime instruction? In the general case, no; it takes several instructions to computexy\\nwhen x and y are real numbers. In restricted situations, however, exponentiation is\\na constant-time operation. Many computers have a “shift left” instruction, which\\nin constant time shifts the bits of an integer byk positions to the left. In most\\ncomputers, shifting the bits of an integer by one position to the left is equivalent\\nto multiplication by 2, so that shifting the bits byk positions to the left is equiv-\\nalent to multiplication by2k . Therefore, such computers can compute2k in one\\nconstant-time instruction by shifting the integer 1 byk positions to the left, as long\\nas k is no more than the number of bits in a computer word. We will endeavor to\\navoid such gray areas in the RAM model, but we will treat computation of2k as a\\nconstant-time operation whenk is a small enough positive integer.\\nIn the RAM model, we do not attempt to model the memory hierarchy that is\\ncommon in contemporary computers. That is, we do not model caches or virtual\\nmemory. Several computational models attempt to account for memory-hierarchy\\neffects, which are sometimes signiﬁcant in real programs on real machines. A\\nhandful of problems in this book examine memory-hierarchy effects, but for the\\nmost part, the analyses in this book will not consider them. Models that include\\nthe memory hierarchy are quite a bit more complex than the RAM model, and so\\nthey can be difﬁcult to work with. Moreover, RAM-model analyses are usually\\nexcellent predictors of performance on actual machines.\\nAnalyzing even a simple algorithm in the RAM model can be a challenge. The\\nmathematical tools required may include combinatorics, probability theory, alge-\\nbraic dexterity, and the ability to identify the most signiﬁcant terms in a formula.\\nBecause the behavior of an algorithm may be different for each possible input, we\\nneed a means for summarizing that behavior in simple, easily understood formulas.\\nEven though we typically select only one machine model to analyze a given al-\\ngorithm, we still face many choices in deciding how to express our analysis. We\\nwould like a way that is simple to write and manipulate, shows the important char-\\nacteristics of an algorithm’s resource requirements, and suppresses tedious details.\\nAnalysisofinsertionsort\\nThe time taken by the INSERTION -SORT procedure depends on the input: sorting a\\nthousand numbers takes longer than sorting three numbers. Moreover, INSERTION -\\nSORT can take different amounts of time to sort two input sequences of the same\\nsize depending on how nearly sorted they already are. In general, the time taken\\nby an algorithm grows with the size of the input, so it is traditional to describe the\\nrunning time of a program as a function of the size of its input. To do so, we need\\nto deﬁne the terms “running time” and “size of input” more carefully.'),\n",

For many\\nproblems, such as sorting or computing discrete Fourier transforms, the most nat-\\nural measure is thenumber of items in the input—for example, the array sizen\\nfor sorting. For many other problems, such as multiplying two integers, the best\\nmeasure of input size is thetotal number of bitsneeded to represent the input in\\nordinary binary notation. Sometimes, it is more appropriate to describe the size of\\nthe input with two numbers rather than one. For instance, if the input to an algo-\\nrithm is a graph, the input size can be described by the numbers of vertices and\\nedges in the graph. We shall indicate which input size measure is being used with\\neach problem we study.\\nThe runningtime of an algorithm on a particular input is the number of primitive\\noperations or “steps” executed. It is convenient to deﬁne the notion of step so\\nthat it is as machine-independent as possible. For the moment, let us adopt the\\nfollowing view. A constant amount of time is required to execute each line of our\\npseudocode. One line may take a different amount of time than another line, but\\nwe shall assume that each execution of thei th line takes timeci , where ci is a\\nconstant. This viewpoint is in keeping with the RAM model, and it also reﬂects\\nhow the pseudocode would be implemented on most actual computers.5\\nIn the following discussion, our expression for the running time of INSERTION -\\nSORT will evolve from a messy formula that uses all the statement costsci to a\\nmuch simpler notation that is more concise and more easily manipulated. This\\nsimpler notation will also make it easy to determine whether one algorithm is more\\nefﬁcient than another.\\nWe start by presenting the INSERTION -SORT procedure with the time “cost”\\nof each statement and the number of times each statement is executed. For each\\nj D2; 3; : : : ; n , wheren DA: length, we lettj denote the number of times the\\nwhileloop test in line 5 is executed for that value ofj . When aforor whileloop\\nexits in the usual way (i.e., due to the test in the loop header), the test is executed\\none time more than the loop body. We assume that comments are not executable\\nstatements, and so they take no time.\\n5There are some subtleties here. Computational steps that we specify in English are often variants\\nof a procedure that requires more than just a constant amount of time. For example, later in this\\nbook we might say “sort the points byx-coordinate,” which, as we shall see, takes more than a\\nconstant amount of time. Also, note that a statement that calls a subroutine takes constant time,\\nthough the subroutine, once invoked, may take more. That is, we separate the process ofcallingthe\\nsubroutine—passing parameters to it, etc.—from the process ofexecutingthe subroutine.'),\n",

Suppose that we\\nrandomly choosen numbers and apply insertion sort. How long does it take to\\ndetermine where in subarrayAŒ1 : : j /NUL 1\\x8d to insert elementAŒj \\x8d ? On average,\\nhalf the elements inAŒ1 : : j /NUL 1\\x8d are less thanAŒj \\x8d , and half the elements are\\ngreater. On average, therefore, we check half of the subarrayAŒ1 : : j /NUL 1\\x8d, and\\nso tj is aboutj=2. The resulting average-case running time turns out to be a\\nquadratic function of the input size, just like the worst-case running time.\\nIn some particular cases, we shall be interested in theaverage-caserunning time\\nof an algorithm; we shall see the technique ofprobabilistic analysisapplied to\\nvarious algorithms throughout this book. The scope of average-case analysis is\\nlimited, because it may not be apparent what constitutes an “average” input for\\na particular problem. Often, we shall assume that all inputs of a given size are\\nequally likely. In practice, this assumption may be violated, but we can sometimes\\nuse arandomizedalgorithm, which makes random choices, to allow a probabilistic\\nanalysis and yield anexpected running time. We explore randomized algorithms\\nmore in Chapter 5 and in several other subsequent chapters.\\nOrderofgrowth\\nWe used some simplifying abstractions to ease our analysis of the INSERTION -\\nSORT procedure. First, we ignored the actual cost of each statement, using the\\nconstants ci to represent these costs. Then, we observed that even these constants\\ngive us more detail than we really need: we expressed the worst-case running time\\nas an2 Cb n Cc for some constantsa, b, and c that depend on the statement\\ncosts ci . We thus ignored not only the actual statement costs, but also the abstract\\ncosts ci .\\nWe shall now make one more simplifying abstraction: it is therate of growth,\\nor order of growth, of the running time that really interests us. We therefore con-\\nsider only the leading term of a formula (e.g.,an2), since the lower-order terms are\\nrelatively insigniﬁcant for large values ofn. We also ignore the leading term’s con-\\nstant coefﬁcient, since constant factors are less signiﬁcant than the rate of growth\\nin determining computational efﬁciency for large inputs. For insertion sort, when\\nwe ignore the lower-order terms and the leading term’s constant coefﬁcient, we are\\nleft with the factor ofn2 from the leading term. We write that insertion sort has a\\nworst-case running time of‚.n2/ (pronounced “theta ofn-squared”). We shall use\\n‚-notation informally in this chapter, and we will deﬁne it precisely in Chapter 3.\\nWe usually consider one algorithm to be more efﬁcient than another if its worst-\\ncase running time has a lower order of growth. Due to constant factors and lower-\\norder terms, an algorithm whose running time has a higher order of growth might\\ntake less time for small inputs than an algorithm whose running time has a lower'),\n",

If the subproblem sizes are\\nsmall enough, however, just solve the subproblems in a straightforward manner.\\nCombinethe solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original prob-\\nlem.\\nThe mergesort algorithm closely follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm. In-\\ntuitively, it operates as follows.\\nDivide: Divide then-element sequence to be sorted into two subsequences ofn=2\\nelements each.\\nConquer: Sort the two subsequences recursively using merge sort.\\nCombine: Merge the two sorted subsequences to produce the sorted answer.\\nThe recursion “bottoms out” when the sequence to be sorted has length 1, in which\\ncase there is no work to be done, since every sequence of length 1 is already in\\nsorted order.\\nThe key operation of the merge sort algorithm is the merging of two sorted\\nsequences in the “combine” step. We merge by calling an auxiliary procedure\\nMERGE .A; p; q; r / , whereA is an array andp, q, andr are indices into the array\\nsuch that p \\x14q < r . The procedure assumes that the subarraysAŒp : : q\\x8d and\\nAŒq C1 : : r \\x8d are in sorted order.

Returning to our card-\\nplaying motif, suppose we have two piles of cards face up on a table. Each pile is\\nsorted, with the smallest cards on top. We wish to merge the two piles into a single\\nsorted output pile, which is to be face down on the table.

The ﬁrst volume ushered in the modern\\nstudy of computer algorithms with a focus on the analysis of running time, and the\\nfull series remains an engaging and worthwhile reference for many of the topics\\npresented here. According to Knuth, the word “algorithm” is derived from the\\nname “al-Khowˆ arizmˆ ı,” a ninth-century Persian mathematician.\\nAho, Hopcroft, and Ullman [5] advocated the asymptotic analysis of algo-\\nrithms—using notations that Chapter 3 introduces, including‚-notation—as a\\nmeans of comparing relative performance. They also popularized the use of re-\\ncurrence relations to describe the running times of recursive algorithms.\\nKnuth [211] provides an encyclopedic treatment of many sorting algorithms. His\\ncomparison of sorting algorithms (page 381) includes exact step-counting analyses,\\nlike the one we performed here for insertion sort. Knuth’s discussion of insertion\\nsort encompasses several variations of the algorithm. The most important of these\\nis Shell’s sort, introduced by D. L. Shell, which uses insertion sort on periodic\\nsubsequences of the input to produce a faster sorting algorithm.\\nMerge sort is also described by Knuth. He mentions that a mechanical colla-\\ntor capable of merging two decks of punched cards in a single pass was invented\\nin 1938. J. von Neumann, one of the pioneers of computer science, apparently\\nwrote a program for merge sort on the EDV AC computer in 1945.\\nThe early history of proving programs correct is described by Gries [153], who\\ncredits P.

This section deﬁnes the basic asymptotic notations\\nand also introduces some common abuses.\\nAsymptoticnotation,functions,andrunningtimes\\nWe will use asymptotic notation primarily to describe the running times of algo-\\nrithms, as when we wrote that insertion sort’s worst-case running time is‚.n2/.\\nAsymptotic notation actually applies to functions, however. Recall that we charac-\\nterized insertion sort’s worst-case running time asan2 Cb n Cc, for some constants\\na, b, andc. By writing that insertion sort’s running time is‚.n2/, we abstracted\\naway some details of this function. Because asymptotic notation applies to func-\\ntions, what we were writing as‚.n2/ was the functionan2 Cb n Cc, which in\\nthat case happened to characterize the worst-case running time of insertion sort.\\nIn this book, the functions to which we apply asymptotic notation will usually\\ncharacterize the running times of algorithms. But asymptotic notation can apply to\\nfunctions that characterize some other aspect of algorithms (the amount of space\\nthey use, for example), or even to functions that have nothing whatsoever to do\\nwith algorithms.\\nEven when we use asymptotic notation to apply to the running time of an al-\\ngorithm, we need to understandwhich running time we mean. Sometimes we are\\ninterested in the worst-case running time. Often, however, we wish to characterize\\nthe running time no matter what the input. In other words, we often wish to make\\na blanket statement that covers all inputs, not just the worst case. We shall see\\nasymptotic notations that are well suited to characterizing running times no matter\\nwhat the input.\\n‚-notation\\nIn Chapter 2, we found that the worst-case running time of insertion sort is\\nT .n/ D‚.n2/.

The ﬁrst equa-\\ntion says that there issome function f .n/ 2‚.n/ such that 2n2 C3n C1 D\\n2n2 Cf .n/ for alln. The second equation says that forany function g.n/ 2‚.n/\\n(such as thef .n/ just mentioned), there issome function h.n/ 2 ‚.n2/ such\\nthat 2n2 Cg.n/ D h.n/ for all n. Note that this interpretation implies that\\n2n2 C3n C1 D‚.n2/, which is what the chaining of equations intuitively gives\\nus.\\no-notation\\nThe asymptotic upper bound provided byO -notation may or may not be asymp-\\ntotically tight. The bound2n2 DO.n2 / is asymptotically tight, but the bound\\n2n DO.n2/ is not. We useo-notation to denote an upper bound that is not asymp-\\ntotically tight.

Like the chemicals the company produces, the stock price of the\\nV olatile Chemical Corporation is rather volatile. You are allowed to buy one unit\\nof stock only one time and then sell it at a later date, buying and selling after the\\nclose of trading for the day. To compensate for this restriction, you are allowed to\\nlearn what the price of the stock will be in the future. Your goal is to maximize\\nyour proﬁt. Figure 4.1 shows the price of the stock over a 17-day period. You\\nmay buy the stock at any one time, starting after day 0, when the price is $100 per\\nshare. Of course, you would want to “buy low, sell high”—buy at the lowest pos-\\nsible price and later on sell at the highest possible price—to maximize your proﬁt.\\nUnfortunately, you might not be able to buy at the lowest price and then sell at the\\nhighest price within a given period. In Figure 4.1, the lowest price occurs after\\nday 7, which occurs after the highest price, after day 1.\\nYou might think that you can always maximize proﬁt by either buying at the\\nlowest price or selling at the highest price. For example, in Figure 4.1, we would\\nmaximize proﬁt by buying at the lowest price, after day 7. If this strategy always\\nworked, then it would be easy to determine how to maximize proﬁt: ﬁnd the highest\\nand lowest prices, and then work left from the highest price to ﬁnd the lowest prior\\nprice, work right from the lowest price to ﬁnd the highest later price, and take\\nthe pair with the greater difference.

If we treat this row as\\nan arrayA, shown in Figure 4.3, we now want to ﬁnd the nonempty, contiguous\\nsubarray ofA whose values have the largest sum. We call this contiguous subarray\\nthe maximum subarray. For example, in the array of Figure 4.3, the maximum\\nsubarray ofAŒ1 : : 16\\x8d is AŒ8 : : 11\\x8d , with the sum43. Thus, you would want to buy\\nthe stock just before day 8 (that is, after day 7) and sell it after day 11, earning a\\nproﬁt of $43 per share.\\nAt ﬁrst glance, this transformation does not help.

That is, we ﬁnd\\nthe midpoint, saymid, of the subarray, and consider the subarraysAŒlow : : mid\\x8d\\nand AŒmid C1 : : high\\x8d. As Figure 4.4(a) shows, any contiguous subarrayAŒi : : j \\x8d\\nof AŒlow : : high\\x8d must lie in exactly one of the following places:\\n\\x0f entirely in the subarrayAŒlow : : mid\\x8d, so thatlow \\x14i \\x14j \\x14mid,\\n\\x0f entirely in the subarrayAŒmid C1 : : high\\x8d, so thatmid < i \\x14j \\x14high, or\\n\\x0f crossing the midpoint, so thatlow \\x14i \\x14mid < j \\x14high.\\nTherefore, a maximum subarray ofAŒlow : : high\\x8d must lie in exactly one of these\\nplaces. In fact, a maximum subarray ofAŒlow : : high\\x8d must have the greatest\\nsum over all subarrays entirely inAŒlow : : mid\\x8d, entirely inAŒmid C1 : : high\\x8d,\\nor crossing the midpoint. We can ﬁnd maximum subarrays ofAŒlow : : mid\\x8d and\\nAŒmidC1 : : high\\x8d recursively, because these two subproblems are smaller instances\\nof the problem of ﬁnding a maximum subarray.

A subar-\\nray with just one element has only one subarray—itself—and so line 2 returns a\\ntuple with the starting and ending indices of just the one element, along with its\\nvalue. Lines 3–11 handle the recursive case. Line 3 does the divide part, comput-\\ning the indexmid of the midpoint. Let’s refer to the subarrayAŒlow : : mid\\x8d as the\\nleft subarrayand toAŒmid C1 : : high\\x8d as theright subarray. Because we know\\nthat the subarrayAŒlow : : high\\x8d contains at least two elements, each of the left and\\nright subarrays must have at least one element. Lines 4 and 5 conquer by recur-\\nsively ﬁnding maximum subarrays within the left and right subarrays, respectively.\\nLines 6–11 form the combine part.

We denote byT .n/ the\\nrunning time of FIND -MAXIMUM -SUBARRAY on a subarray ofn elements. For\\nstarters, line 1 takes constant time.

Thus, we end up with two terms\\nof ‚.n2/, which we can combine into one.\\nWhen we account for the eight recursive calls, however, we cannot just sub-\\nsume the constant factor of8.

We\\nkeep the troublesome boundary conditionT .1/ D1, but remove it from consid-\\neration in the inductive proof.

Do not worry about whether values\\nare integral.\\n4.4 Therecursion-tree methodforsolvingrecurrences\\nAlthough you can use the substitution method to provide a succinct proof that\\na solution to a recurrence is correct, you might have trouble coming up with a\\ngood guess. Drawing out a recursion tree, as we did in our analysis of the merge\\nsort recurrence in Section 2.3.2, serves as a straightforward way to devise a good\\nguess. In arecursion tree, each node represents the cost of a single subproblem\\nsomewhere in the set of recursive function invocations. We sum the costs within\\neach level of the tree to obtain a set of per-level costs, and then we sum all the\\nper-level costs to determine the total cost of all levels of the recursion.\\nA recursion tree is best used to generate a good guess, which you can then verify\\nby the substitution method. When using a recursion tree to generate a good guess,\\nyou can often tolerate a small amount of “sloppiness,” since you will be verifying\\nyour guess later on. If you are very careful when drawing out a recursion tree and\\nsumming the costs, however, you can use a recursion tree as a direct proof of a\\nsolution to a recurrence. In this section, we will use recursion trees to generate\\ngood guesses, and in Section 4.6, we will use recursion trees directly to prove the\\ntheorem that forms the basis of the master method.\\nFor example, let us see how a recursion tree would provide a good guess for\\nthe recurrenceT .n/ D3T . bn=4c/ C‚.n2/. We start by focusing on ﬁnding an\\nupper bound for the solution. Because we know that ﬂoors and ceilings usually do\\nnot matter when solving recurrences (here’s an example of sloppiness that we can\\ntolerate), we create a recursion tree for the recurrenceT .n/ D3T .n=4/ Ccn2,\\nhaving written out the implied constant coefﬁcientc > 0 .\\nFigure 4.5 shows how we derive the recursion tree forT .n/ D3T .n=4/ Ccn2.\\nFor convenience, we assume thatn is an exact power of4 (another example of\\ntolerable sloppiness) so that all subproblem sizes are integers. Part (a) of the ﬁgure\\nshows T .n/ , which we expand in part (b) into an equivalent tree representing the\\nrecurrence. Thecn2 term at the root represents the cost at the top level of recursion,\\nand the three subtrees of the root represent the costs incurred by the subproblems\\nof sizen=4. Part (c) shows this process carried one step further by expanding each\\nnode with costT .n=4/ from part (b). The cost for each of the three children of the\\nroot isc.n=4/2. We continue expanding each node in the tree by breaking it into\\nits constituent parts as determined by the recurrence.'),\n",

It might have been used well be-\\nfore then, however; according to Heideman, Johnson, and Burrus [163], C. F. Gauss\\ndevised the ﬁrst fast Fourier transform algorithm in 1805, and Gauss’s formulation\\nbreaks the problem into smaller subproblems whose solutions are combined.\\nThe maximum-subarray problem in Section 4.1 is a minor variation on a problem\\nstudied by Bentley [43, Chapter 7].\\nStrassen’s algorithm [325] caused much excitement when it was published\\nin 1969. Before then, few imagined the possibility of an algorithm asymptotically\\nfaster than the basic SQUARE -MATRIX -MULTIPLY procedure. The asymptotic\\nupper bound for matrix multiplication has been improved since then. The most\\nasymptotically efﬁcient algorithm for multiplyingn \\x02n matrices to date, due to\\nCoppersmith and Winograd [78], has a running time ofO.n2:376 /. The best lower\\nbound known is just the obvious\\x7f.n2/ bound (obvious because we must ﬁll inn2\\nelements of the product matrix).\\nFrom a practical point of view, Strassen’s algorithm is often not the method of\\nchoice for matrix multiplication, for four reasons:\\n1. The constant factor hidden in the‚.nlg 7/ running time of Strassen’s algo-\\nrithm is larger than the constant factor in the‚.n3/-time SQUARE -MATRIX -\\nMULTIPLY procedure.\\n2. When the matrices are sparse, methods tailored for sparse matrices are faster.'),\n",

Strassen’s algorithm is not quite as numerically stable as SQUARE -MATRIX -\\nMULTIPLY . In other words, because of the limited precision of computer arith-\\nmetic on noninteger values, larger errors accumulate in Strassen’s algorithm\\nthan in SQUARE -MATRIX -MULTIPLY .\\n4. The submatrices formed at the levels of recursion consume space.\\nThe latter two reasons were mitigated around 1990. Higham [167] demonstrated\\nthat the difference in numerical stability had been overemphasized; although\\nStrassen’s algorithm is too numerically unstable for some applications, it is within\\nacceptable limits for others. Bailey, Lee, and Simon [32] discuss techniques for\\nreducing the memory requirements for Strassen’s algorithm.\\nIn practice, fast matrix-multiplication implementations for dense matrices use\\nStrassen’s algorithm for matrix sizes above a “crossover point,” and they switch\\nto a simpler method once the subproblem size reduces to below the crossover\\npoint. The exact value of the crossover point is highly system dependent. Analyses\\nthat count operations but ignore effects from caches and pipelining have produced\\ncrossover points as low asn D8 (by Higham [167]) orn D12 (by Huss-Lederman\\net al. [186]). D’Alberto and Nicolau [81] developed an adaptive scheme, which\\ndetermines the crossover point by benchmarking when their software package is\\ninstalled. They found crossover points on various systems ranging fromn D400\\nto n D2150, and they could not ﬁnd a crossover point on a couple of systems.\\nRecurrences were studied as early as 1202 by L. Fibonacci, for whom the Fi-\\nbonacci numbers are named. A. De Moivre introduced the method of generating\\nfunctions (see Problem 4-4) for solving recurrences. The master method is adapted\\nfrom Bentley, Haken, and Saxe [44], which provides the extended method justiﬁed\\nby Exercise 4.6-2. Knuth [209] and Liu [237] show how to solve linear recurrences\\nusing the method of generating functions. Purdom and Brown [287] and Graham,\\nKnuth, and Patashnik [152] contain extended discussions of recurrence solving.\\nSeveral researchers, including Akra and Bazzi [13], Roura [299], Verma [346],\\nand Yap [360], have given methods for solving more general divide-and-conquer\\nrecurrences than are solved by the master method. We describe the result of Akra\\nand Bazzi here, as modiﬁed by Leighton [228]. The Akra-Bazzi method works for\\nrecurrences of the form\\nT .x/ D\\n(\\n‚.1/ if 1 \\x14x \\x14x0 ;Pk\\ni D1 ai T .b i x/ Cf .x/ if x > x 0 ; (4.30)\\nwhere\\n\\x0f x \\x151 is a real number,\\n\\x0f x0 is a constant such thatx0 \\x151=bi and x0 \\x151=.1 /NUL bi / for i D1; 2; : : : ; k ,\\n\\x0f ai is a positive constant fori D1; 2; : : : ; k ,'),\n",

Therefore, you decide that, after interviewing\\neach applicant, if that applicant is better qualiﬁed than the current ofﬁce assistant,\\nyou will ﬁre the current ofﬁce assistant and hire the new applicant. You are willing\\nto pay the resulting price of this strategy, but you wish to estimate what that price\\nwill be.\\nThe procedure HIRE -ASSISTANT , given below, expresses this strategy for hiring\\nin pseudocode. It assumes that the candidates for the ofﬁce assistant job are num-\\nbered 1 through n. The procedure assumes that you are able to, after interviewing\\ncandidate i , determine whether candidatei is the best candidate you have seen so\\nfar. To initialize, the procedure creates a dummy candidate, numbered 0, who is\\nless qualiﬁed than each of the other candidates.'),\n",

There are several reasons:\\n\\x0f Sometimes an application inherently needs to sort information. For example,\\nin order to prepare customer statements, banks need to sort checks by check\\nnumber.\\n\\x0f Algorithms often use sorting as a key subroutine. For example, a program that\\nrenders graphical objects which are layered on top of each other might have\\nto sort the objects according to an “above” relation so that it can draw these\\nobjects from bottom to top. We shall see numerous algorithms in this text that\\nuse sorting as a subroutine.\\n\\x0f We can draw from among a wide variety of sorting algorithms, and they em-\\nploy a rich set of techniques. In fact, many important techniques used through-\\nout algorithm design appear in the body of sorting algorithms that have been\\ndeveloped over the years. In this way, sorting is also a problem of historical\\ninterest.\\n\\x0f We can prove a nontrivial lower bound for sorting (as we shall do in Chapter 8).\\nOur best upper bounds match the lower bound asymptotically, and so we know\\nthat our sorting algorithms are asymptotically optimal. Moreover, we can use\\nthe lower bound for sorting to prove lower bounds for certain other problems.\\n\\x0f Many engineering issues come to the fore when implementing sorting algo-\\nrithms. The fastest sorting program for a particular situation may depend on\\nmany factors, such as prior knowledge about the keys and satellite data, the\\nmemory hierarchy (caches and virtual memory) of the host computer, and the\\nsoftware environment. Many of these issues are best dealt with at the algorith-\\nmic level, rather than by “tweaking” the code.\\nSortingalgorithms\\nWe introduced two algorithms that sortn real numbers in Chapter 2. Insertion sort\\ntakes ‚.n2/ time in the worst case. Because its inner loops are tight, however,\\nit is a fast in-place sorting algorithm for small input sizes. (Recall that a sorting\\nalgorithm sorts in placeif only a constant number of elements of the input ar-\\nray are ever stored outside the array.) Merge sort has a better asymptotic running\\ntime, ‚.n lg n/, but the MERGE procedure it uses does not operate in place.'),\n",

Heapsort, presented in Chapter 6, sortsn numbers in place inO.n lg n/ time.\\nIt uses an important data structure, called a heap, with which we can also imple-\\nment a priority queue.\\nQuicksort, in Chapter 7, also sortsn numbers in place, but its worst-case running\\ntime is‚.n2/. Its expected running time is‚.n lg n/, however, and it generally\\noutperforms heapsort in practice. Like insertion sort, quicksort has tight code, and\\nso the hidden constant factor in its running time is small. It is a popular algorithm\\nfor sorting large input arrays.\\nInsertion sort, merge sort, heapsort, and quicksort are all comparison sorts: they\\ndetermine the sorted order of an input array by comparing elements. Chapter 8 be-\\ngins by introducing the decision-tree model in order to study the performance limi-\\ntations of comparison sorts. Using this model, we prove a lower bound of\\x7f.n lg n/\\non the worst-case running time of any comparison sort onn inputs, thus showing\\nthat heapsort and merge sort are asymptotically optimal comparison sorts.\\nChapter 8 then goes on to show that we can beat this lower bound of\\x7f.n lg n/\\nif we can gather information about the sorted order of the input by means other\\nthan comparing elements. The counting sort algorithm, for example, assumes that\\nthe input numbers are in the setf0; 1; : : : ; k g. By using array indexing as a tool\\nfor determining relative order, counting sort can sortn numbers in‚.k Cn/ time.\\nThus, whenk DO.n/, counting sort runs in time that is linear in the size of the\\ninput array. A related algorithm, radix sort, can be used to extend the range of\\ncounting sort. If there aren integers to sort, each integer hasd digits, and each\\ndigit can take on up tok possible values, then radix sort can sort the numbers\\nin ‚.d.n Ck// time. When d is a constant andk is O.n/, radix sort runs in\\nlinear time. A third algorithm, bucket sort, requires knowledge of the probabilistic\\ndistribution of numbers in the input array. It can sortn real numbers uniformly\\ndistributed in the half-open intervalŒ0; 1/ in average-caseO.n/ time.\\nThe following table summarizes the running times of the sorting algorithms from\\nChapters 2 and 6–8. As usual,n denotes the number of items to sort. For counting\\nsort, the items to sort are integers in the setf0; 1; : : : ; k g. For radix sort, each item\\nis ad -digit number, where each digit takes onk possible values. For bucket sort,\\nwe assume that the keys are real numbers uniformly distributed in the half-open\\ninterval Œ0; 1/ . The rightmost column gives the average-case or expected running\\ntime, indicating which it gives when it differs from the worst-case running time.\\nWe omit the average-case running time of heapsort because we do not analyze it in\\nthis book.'),\n",

Like merge sort,\\nbut unlike insertion sort, heapsort’s running time isO.n lg n/.

Thus, heapsort combines\\nthe better attributes of the two sorting algorithms we have already discussed.\\nHeapsort also introduces another algorithm design technique: using a data struc-\\nture, in this case one we call a “heap,” to manage information. Not only is the heap\\ndata structure useful for heapsort, but it also makes an efﬁcient priority queue. The\\nheap data structure will reappear in algorithms in later chapters.\\nThe term “heap” was originally coined in the context of heapsort, but it has since\\ncome to refer to “garbage-collected storage,” such as the programming languages\\nJava and Lisp provide. Our heap data structure isnot garbage-collected storage,\\nand whenever we refer to heaps in this book, we shall mean a data structure rather\\nthan an aspect of garbage collection.\\n6.1 Heaps\\nThe (binary) heap data structure is an array object that we can view as a\\nnearly complete binary tree (see Section B.5.3), as shown in Figure 6.1. Each\\nnode of the tree corresponds to an element of the array. The tree is com-\\npletely ﬁlled on all levels except possibly the lowest, which is ﬁlled from the\\nleft up to a point. An arrayA that represents a heap is an object with two at-\\ntributes: A: length, which (as usual) gives the number of elements in the array, and\\nA: heap-size, which represents how many elements in the heap are stored within\\narray A. That is, althoughAŒ1 : : A: length\\x8d may contain numbers, only the ele-\\nments inAŒ1 : : A: heap-size\\x8d, where0 \\x14A: heap-size \\x14A: length, are valid ele-\\nments of the heap.

Nevertheless, the heap data struc-\\nture itself has many uses. In this section, we present one of the most popular ap-\\nplications of a heap: as an efﬁcient priority queue. As with heaps, priority queues\\ncome in two forms: max-priority queues and min-priority queues. We will focus\\nhere on how to implement max-priority queues, which are in turn based on max-\\nheaps; Exercise 6.5-3 asks you to write the procedures for min-priority queues.\\nA priority queueis a data structure for maintaining a setS of elements, each\\nwith an associated value called akey. Amax-priorityqueue supports the following\\noperations:\\nINSERT .S; x/ inserts the elementx into the setS , which is equivalent to the oper-\\nation S DS [fxg.\\nMAXIMUM .S / returns the element ofS with the largest key.\\nEXTRACT -MAX .S / removes and returns the element ofS with the largest key.\\nINCREASE -KEY .S; x; k/ increases the value of elementx’s key to the new valuek,\\nwhich is assumed to be at least as large asx’s current key value.\\nAmong their other applications, we can use max-priority queues to schedule\\njobs on a shared computer. The max-priority queue keeps track of the jobs to\\nbe performed and their relative priorities. When a job is ﬁnished or interrupted,\\nthe scheduler selects the highest-priority job from among those pending by calling\\nEXTRACT -MAX. The scheduler can add a new job to the queue at any time by\\ncalling INSERT .\\nAlternatively, amin-priorityqueue supports the operations INSERT , MINIMUM ,\\nEXTRACT -MIN, and DECREASE -KEY. A min-priority queue can be used in an\\nevent-driven simulator. The items in the queue are events to be simulated, each\\nwith an associated time of occurrence that serves as its key. The events must be\\nsimulated in order of their time of occurrence, because the simulation of an event\\ncan cause other events to be simulated in the future. The simulation program calls\\nEXTRACT -MIN at each step to choose the next event to simulate. As new events are\\nproduced, the simulator inserts them into the min-priority queue by calling INSERT .'),\n",

In a given ap-\\nplication, such as job scheduling or event-driven simulation, elements of a priority\\nqueue correspond to objects in the application. We often need to determine which\\napplication object corresponds to a given priority-queue element, and vice versa.\\nWhen we use a heap to implement a priority queue, therefore, we often need to\\nstore ahandle to the corresponding application object in each heap element. The\\nexact makeup of the handle (such as a pointer or an integer) depends on the ap-\\nplication. Similarly, we need to store a handle to the corresponding heap element\\nin each application object. Here, the handle would typically be an array index.\\nBecause heap elements change locations within the array during heap operations,\\nan actual implementation, upon relocating a heap element, would also have to up-\\ndate the array index in the corresponding application object.

Despite this slow worst-case running time, quicksort is often the best\\npractical choice for sorting because it is remarkably efﬁcient on the average: its\\nexpected running time is‚.n lg n/, and the constant factors hidden in the‚.n lg n/\\nnotation are quite small. It also has the advantage of sorting in place (see page 17),\\nand it works well even in virtual-memory environments.\\nSection 7.1 describes the algorithm and an important subroutine used by quick-\\nsort for partitioning. Because the behavior of quicksort is complex, we start with\\nan intuitive discussion of its performance in Section 7.2 and postpone its precise\\nanalysis to the end of the chapter. Section 7.3 presents a version of quicksort that\\nuses random sampling. This algorithm has a good expected running time, and no\\nparticular input elicits its worst-case behavior. Section 7.4 analyzes the random-\\nized algorithm, showing that it runs in‚.n2/ time in the worst case and, assuming\\ndistinct elements, in expectedO.n lg n/ time.\\n7.1 Descriptionofquicksort\\nQuicksort, like merge sort, applies the divide-and-conquer paradigm introduced\\nin Section 2.3.1.

In this section, we shall informally investigate how quicksort\\nperforms under the assumptions of balanced versus unbalanced partitioning.\\nWorst-case partitioning\\nThe worst-case behavior for quicksort occurs when the partitioning routine pro-\\nduces one subproblem withn /NUL 1 elements and one with0 elements. (We prove\\nthis claim in Section 7.4.1.) Let us assume that this unbalanced partitioning arises\\nin each recursive call. The partitioning costs‚.n/ time. Since the recursive call\\non an array of size0 just returns,T .0/ D‚.1/, and the recurrence for the running\\ntime is\\nT .n/ D T .n /NUL 1/ CT .0/ C‚.n/\\nD T .n /NUL 1/ C‚.n/ :\\nIntuitively, if we sum the costs incurred at each level of the recursion, we get\\nan arithmetic series (equation (A.2)), which evaluates to‚.n2/. Indeed, it is\\nstraightforward to use the substitution method to prove that the recurrenceT .n/ D\\nT .n /NUL 1/ C‚.n/ has the solutionT .n/ D‚.n2/. (See Exercise 7.2-1.)\\nThus, if the partitioning is maximally unbalanced at every recursive level of the\\nalgorithm, the running time is‚.n2/. Therefore the worst-case running time of\\nquicksort is no better than that of insertion sort. Moreover, the‚.n2/ running time\\noccurs when the input array is already completely sorted—a common situation in\\nwhich insertion sort runs inO.n/ time.\\nBest-case partitioning\\nIn the most even possible split, PARTITION produces two subproblems, each of\\nsize no more thann=2, since one is of sizebn=2cand one of sizedn=2e/NUL 1. In this\\ncase, quicksort runs much faster. The recurrence for the running time is then\\nT .n/ D2T .n=2/ C‚.n/ ;\\nwhere we tolerate the sloppiness from ignoring the ﬂoor and ceiling and from sub-\\ntracting 1. By case 2 of the master theorem (Theorem 4.1), this recurrence has the\\nsolution T .n/ D‚.n lg n/. By equally balancing the two sides of the partition at\\nevery level of the recursion, we get an asymptotically faster algorithm.\\nBalancedpartitioning\\nThe average-case running time of quicksort is much closer to the best case than to\\nthe worst case, as the analyses in Section 7.4 will show.

We expect that some of the splits will be reasonably well balanced and\\nthat some will be fairly unbalanced. For example, Exercise 7.2-6 asks you to show\\nthat about 80 percent of the time PARTITION produces a split that is more balanced\\nthan 9 to 1, and about 20 percent of the time it produces a split that is less balanced\\nthan 9 to 1.\\nIn the average case, PARTITION produces a mix of “good” and “bad” splits.

Each time the PARTITION procedure is called, it selects a pivot\\nelement, and this element is never included in any future recursive calls to QUICK -\\nSORT and PARTITION . Thus, there can be at mostn calls to PARTITION over the\\nentire execution of the quicksort algorithm.

Our analysis assumes that the\\nRANDOMIZED -PARTITION procedure chooses each pivot randomly and indepen-\\ndently.\\nLet us think about when two items arenot compared. Consider an input to\\nquicksort of the numbers1 through 10 (in any order), and suppose that the ﬁrst\\npivot element is7. Then the ﬁrst call to PARTITION separates the numbers into two\\nsets: f1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6 gand f8; 9; 10 g. In doing so, the pivot element7 is compared\\nto all other elements, but no number from the ﬁrst set (e.g., 2) is or ever will be\\ncompared to any number from the second set (e.g., 9).\\nIn general, because we assume that element values are distinct, once a pivotx\\nis chosen with´i < x < ´ j , we know that´i and ´j cannot be compared at any\\nsubsequent time. If, on the other hand,´i is chosen as a pivot before any other item\\nin Zi j, then´i will be compared to each item inZi j , except for itself. Similarly,\\nif ´j is chosen as a pivot before any other item inZi j , then´j will be compared to\\neach item inZi j , except for itself. In our example, the values7 and 9 are compared\\nbecause 7 is the ﬁrst item fromZ7;9 to be chosen as a pivot. In contrast,2 and 9 will\\nnever be compared because the ﬁrst pivot element chosen fromZ2;9 is 7. Thus,´i\\nand ´j are compared if and only if the ﬁrst element to be chosen as a pivot fromZi j\\nis either´i or ´j .\\nWe now compute the probability that this event occurs. Prior to the point at\\nwhich an element fromZi j has been chosen as a pivot, the whole setZi j is together\\nin the same partition.

Your algorithm should use‚.n Ck/ preprocessing\\ntime.\\n8.3 Radixsort\\nRadixsort is the algorithm used by the card-sorting machines you now ﬁnd only in\\ncomputer museums. The cards have 80 columns, and in each column a machine can\\npunch a hole in one of 12 places. The sorter can be mechanically “programmed”\\nto examine a given column of each card in a deck and distribute the card into one\\nof 12 bins depending on which place has been punched. An operator can then\\ngather the cards bin by bin, so that cards with the ﬁrst place punched are on top of\\ncards with the second place punched, and so on.\\nFor decimal digits, each column uses only 10 places. (The other two places\\nare reserved for encoding nonnumeric characters.) Ad -digit number would then\\noccupy a ﬁeld ofd columns. Since the card sorter can look at only one column\\nat a time, the problem of sortingn cards on ad -digit number requires a sorting\\nalgorithm.\\nIntuitively, you might sort numbers on theirmost signiﬁcantdigit, sort each of\\nthe resulting bins recursively, and then combine the decks in order. Unfortunately,\\nsince the cards in9 of the10 bins must be put aside to sort each of the bins, this\\nprocedure generates many intermediate piles of cards that you would have to keep\\ntrack of. (See Exercise 8.3-5.)\\nRadix sort solves the problem of card sorting—counterintuitively—by sorting on\\nthe least signiﬁcantdigit ﬁrst. The algorithm then combines the cards into a single\\ndeck, with the cards in the0 bin preceding the cards in the1 bin preceding the\\ncards in the2 bin, and so on. Then it sorts the entire deck again on the second-least\\nsigniﬁcant digit and recombines the deck in a like manner. The process continues\\nuntil the cards have been sorted on alld digits. Remarkably, at that point the cards\\nare fully sorted on thed -digit number. Thus, onlyd passes through the deck are\\nrequired to sort. Figure 8.3 shows how radix sort operates on a “deck” of seven\\n3-digit numbers.\\nIn order for radix sort to work correctly, the digit sorts must be stable. The sort\\nperformed by a card sorter is stable, but the operator has to be wary about not\\nchanging the order of the cards as they come out of a bin, even though all the cards\\nin a bin have the same digit in the chosen column.'),\n",

Several positive results have been obtained, each under slightly\\ndifferent assumptions about the model of computation and the restrictions placed\\non the algorithm. All the results assume that the computer memory is divided into\\naddressable b-bit words. Fredman and Willard [115] introduced the fusion tree data\\nstructure and used it to sortn integers inO.n lg n= lg lgn/ time. This bound was\\nlater improved toO.n\\np\\nlg n/ time by Andersson [16]. These algorithms require\\nthe use of multiplication and several precomputed constants. Andersson, Hagerup,\\nNilsson, and Raman [17] have shown how to sortn integers inO.n lg lgn/ time\\nwithout using multiplication, but their method requires storage that can be un-\\nbounded in terms ofn. Using multiplicative hashing, we can reduce the storage\\nneeded toO.n/, but then theO.n lg lgn/ worst-case bound on the running time\\nbecomes an expected-time bound. Generalizing the exponential search trees of\\nAndersson [16], Thorup [335] gave anO.n.lg lgn/2/-time sorting algorithm that\\ndoes not use multiplication or randomization, and it uses linear space. Combining\\nthese techniques with some new ideas, Han [158] improved the bound for sorting\\nto O.n lg lgn lg lg lgn/ time. Although these algorithms are important theoretical\\nbreakthroughs, they are all fairly complicated and at the present time seem unlikely\\nto compete with existing sorting algorithms in practice.\\nThe columnsort algorithm in Problem 8-7 is by Leighton [227].'),\n",

Whenn is odd, the median is unique, occurring at\\ni D.n C1/=2. Whenn is even, there are two medians, occurring ati Dn=2 and\\ni Dn=2 C1. Thus, regardless of the parity ofn, medians occur ati Db.n C1/=2c\\n(the lower median) andi Dd.n C1/=2e(the upper median).

Yes, since we can obtain a lower bound ofn /NUL 1\\ncomparisons for the problem of determining the minimum. Think of any algorithm\\nthat determines the minimum as a tournament among the elements. Each compar-\\nison is a match in the tournament in which the smaller of the two elements wins.\\nObserving that every element except the winner must lose at least one match, we\\nconclude thatn /NUL 1 comparisons are necessary to determine the minimum. Hence,\\nthe algorithm MINIMUM is optimal with respect to the number of comparisons\\nperformed.\\nSimultaneousminimumandmaximum\\nIn some applications, we must ﬁnd both the minimum and the maximum of a set\\nof n elements. For example, a graphics program may need to scale a set of.x; y/\\ndata to ﬁt onto a rectangular display screen or other graphical output device. To\\ndo so, the program must ﬁrst determine the minimum and maximum value of each\\ncoordinate.\\nAt this point, it should be obvious how to determine both the minimum and the\\nmaximum ofn elements using‚.n/ comparisons, which is asymptotically optimal:\\nsimply ﬁnd the minimum and maximum independently, usingn /NUL 1 comparisons\\nfor each, for a total of2n /NUL 2 comparisons.\\nIn fact, we can ﬁnd both the minimum and the maximum using at most3 bn=2c\\ncomparisons.

In this case,i must equal1, and we simply returnAŒp\\x8d in line 2 as the\\ni th smallest element.

In many programming languages,\\nan object occupies a contiguous set of locations in the computer memory. A pointer\\nis simply the address of the ﬁrst memory location of the object, and we can address\\nother memory locations within the object by adding an offset to the pointer.\\nWe can use the same strategy for implementing objects in programming envi-\\nronments that do not provide explicit pointer data types. For example, Figure 10.6\\nshows how to use a single arrayA to store the linked list from Figures 10.3(a)\\nand 10.5. An object occupies a contiguous subarrayAŒj : : k\\x8d . Each attribute of\\nthe object corresponds to an offset in the range from0 to k /NUL j , and a pointer to\\nthe object is the indexj . In Figure 10.6, the offsets corresponding tokey, next, and\\npre\\x17 are 0, 1, and 2, respectively. To read the value ofi: pre\\x17, given a pointeri , we\\nadd the valuei of the pointer to the offset2, thus readingAŒi C2\\x8d.\\nThe single-array representation is ﬂexible in that it permits objects of different\\nlengths to be stored in the same array. The problem of managing such a heteroge-\\nneous collection of objects is more difﬁcult than the problem of managing a homo-\\ngeneous collection, where all objects have the same attributes. Since most of the\\ndata structures we shall consider are composed of homogeneous elements, it will\\nbe sufﬁcient for our purposes to use the multiple-array representation of objects.'),\n",

Each list\\nelement is an object that occupies a contiguous subarray of length 3 within the array. The three\\nattributes key, next, andpre\\x17 correspond to the offsets 0, 1, and 2, respectively, within each object.\\nA pointer to an object is the index of the ﬁrst element of the object. Objects containing list elements\\nare lightly shaded, and arrows show the list ordering.\\nAllocatingandfreeingobjects\\nTo insert a key into a dynamic set represented by a doubly linked list, we must al-\\nlocate a pointer to a currently unused object in the linked-list representation. Thus,\\nit is useful to manage the storage of objects not currently used in the linked-list\\nrepresentation so that one can be allocated. In some systems, agarbage collec-\\ntor is responsible for determining which objects are unused. Many applications,\\nhowever, are simple enough that they can bear responsibility for returning an un-\\nused object to a storage manager. We shall now explore the problem of allocating\\nand freeing (or deallocating) homogeneous objects using the example of a doubly\\nlinked list represented by multiple arrays.\\nSuppose that the arrays in the multiple-array representation have lengthm and\\nthat at some moment the dynamic set containsn \\x14m elements. Then n objects\\nrepresent elements currently in the dynamic set, and the remainingm/NULn objects are\\nfree; the free objects are available to represent elements inserted into the dynamic\\nset in the future.\\nWe keep the free objects in a singly linked list, which we call thefree list. The\\nfree list uses only thenext array, which stores thenext pointers within the list.\\nThe head of the free list is held in the global variablefree. When the dynamic\\nset represented by linked listL is nonempty, the free list may be intertwined with\\nlist L, as shown in Figure 10.7. Note that each object in the representation is either\\nin listL or in the free list, but not in both.\\nThe free list acts like a stack: the next object allocated is the last one freed. We\\ncan use a list implementation of the stack operations PUSH and POP to implement\\nthe procedures for allocating and freeing objects, respectively. We assume that the\\nglobal variablefree used in the following procedures points to the ﬁrst element of\\nthe free list.'),\n",

In this section, we look speciﬁcally at the problem of\\nrepresenting rooted trees by linked data structures. We ﬁrst look at binary trees,\\nand then we present a method for rooted trees in which nodes can have an arbitrary\\nnumber of children.\\nWe represent each node of a tree by an object. As with linked lists, we assume\\nthat each node contains akey attribute. The remaining attributes of interest are\\npointers to other nodes, and they vary according to the type of tree.\\nBinarytrees\\nFigure 10.9 shows how we use the attributesp, left, andright to store pointers to\\nthe parent, left child, and right child of each node in a binary treeT . Ifx: p DNIL ,\\nthen x is the root. If nodex has no left child, thenx: left DNIL , and similarly for\\nthe right child. The root of the entire treeT is pointed to by the attributeT: root. If\\nT: root DNIL , then the tree is empty.\\nRootedtrees withunboundedbranching\\nWe can extend the scheme for representing a binary tree to any class of trees in\\nwhich the number of children of each node is at most some constantk: we replace\\nthe left and right attributes bychild1; child2; : : : ; childk . This scheme no longer\\nworks when the number of children of a node is unbounded, since we do not know\\nhow many attributes (arrays in the multiple-array representation) to allocate in ad-\\nvance. Moreover, even if the number of childrenk is bounded by a large constant\\nbut most nodes have a small number of children, we may waste a lot of memory.\\nFortunately, there is a clever scheme to represent trees with arbitrary numbers of\\nchildren. It has the advantage of using onlyO.n/ space for anyn-node rooted tree.\\nThe left-child, right-sibling representationappears in Figure 10.10. As before,\\neach node contains a parent pointerp, and T: root points to the root of treeT .\\nInstead of having a pointer to each of its children, however, each nodex has only\\ntwo pointers:\\n1. x: left-child points to the leftmost child of nodex, and\\n2. x: right-sibling points to the sibling ofx immediately to its right.\\nIf nodex has no children, thenx: left-child DNIL , and if nodex is the rightmost\\nchild of its parent, thenx: right-sibling DNIL .'),\n",

Gonnet [145] provides experimental data on the perfor-\\nmance of many data-structure operations.\\nThe origin of stacks and queues as data structures in computer science is un-\\nclear, since corresponding notions already existed in mathematics and paper-based\\nbusiness practices before the introduction of digital computers. Knuth [209] cites\\nA. M. Turing for the development of stacks for subroutine linkage in 1947.\\nPointer-based data structures also seem to be a folk invention. According to\\nKnuth, pointers were apparently used in early computers with drum memories. The\\nA-1 language developed by G. M. Hopper in 1951 represented algebraic formulas\\nas binary trees. Knuth credits the IPL-II language, developed in 1956 by A. Newell,\\nJ. C. Shaw, and H. A. Simon, for recognizing the importance and promoting the\\nuse of pointers.

For example, a compiler that translates a\\nprogramming language maintains a symbol table, in which the keys of elements\\nare arbitrary character strings corresponding to identiﬁers in the language. A hash\\ntable is an effective data structure for implementing dictionaries. Although search-\\ning for an element in a hash table can take as long as searching for an element in a\\nlinked list—‚.n/ time in the worst case—in practice, hashing performs extremely\\nwell. Under reasonable assumptions, the average time to search for an element in\\na hash table isO.1/.\\nA hash table generalizes the simpler notion of an ordinary array. Directly ad-\\ndressing into an ordinary array makes effective use of our ability to examine an\\narbitrary position in an array inO.1/ time. Section 11.1 discusses direct address-\\ning in more detail. We can take advantage of direct addressing when we can afford\\nto allocate an array that has one position for every possible key.\\nWhen the number of keys actually stored is small relative to the total number of\\npossible keys, hash tables become an effective alternative to directly addressing an\\narray, since a hash table typically uses an array of size proportional to the number\\nof keys actually stored. Instead of using the key as an array index directly, the array\\nindex iscomputed from the key. Section 11.2 presents the main ideas, focusing on\\n“chaining” as a way to handle “collisions,” in which more than one key maps to the\\nsame array index. Section 11.3 describes how we can compute array indices from\\nkeys using hash functions. We present and analyze several variations on the basic\\ntheme.

Two of the schemes, hashing by\\ndivision and hashing by multiplication, are heuristic in nature, whereas the third\\nscheme, universal hashing, uses randomization to provide provably good perfor-\\nmance.\\nWhatmakesagoodhashfunction?\\nA good hash function satisﬁes (approximately) the assumption of simple uniform\\nhashing: each key is equally likely to hash to any of them slots, independently of\\nwhere any other key has hashed to. Unfortunately, we typically have no way to\\ncheck this condition, since we rarely know the probability distribution from which\\nthe keys are drawn. Moreover, the keys might not be drawn independently.\\nOccasionally we do know the distribution. For example, if we know that the\\nkeys are random real numbersk independently and uniformly distributed in the\\nrange 0 \\x14k < 1 , then the hash function\\nh.k/ Dbkmc\\nsatisﬁes the condition of simple uniform hashing.\\nIn practice, we can often employ heuristic techniques to create a hash function\\nthat performs well. Qualitative information about the distribution of keys may be\\nuseful in this design process. For example, consider a compiler’s symbol table, in\\nwhich the keys are character strings representing identiﬁers in a program. Closely\\nrelated symbols, such aspt and pts, often occur in the same program. A good\\nhash function would minimize the chance that such variants hash to the same slot.\\nA good approach derives the hash value in a way that we expect to be indepen-\\ndent of any patterns that might exist in the data. For example, the “division method”\\n(discussed in Section 11.3.1) computes the hash value as the remainder when the\\nkey is divided by a speciﬁed prime number. This method frequently gives good\\nresults, assuming that we choose a prime number that is unrelated to any patterns\\nin the distribution of keys.\\nFinally, we note that some applications of hash functions might require stronger\\nproperties than are provided by simple uniform hashing. For example, we might\\nwant keys that are “close” in some sense to yield hash values that are far apart.\\n(This property is especially desirable when we are using linear probing, deﬁned in\\nSection 11.4.) Universal hashing, described in Section 11.3.3, often provides the\\ndesired properties.'),\n",

Thus, if the keys are not natural numbers, we ﬁnd a way to\\ninterpret them as natural numbers. For example, we can interpret a character string\\nas an integer expressed in suitable radix notation. Thus, we might interpret the\\nidentiﬁer ptas the pair of decimal integers.112; 116/ , sincepD112 and tD116\\nin the ASCII character set; then, expressed as a radix-128 integer,pt becomes\\n.112 \\x01128/ C116 D14452. In the context of a given application, we can usually\\ndevise some such method for interpreting each key as a (possibly large) natural\\nnumber. In what follows, we assume that the keys are natural numbers.\\n11.3.1 Thedivisionmethod\\nIn thedivision methodfor creating hash functions, we map a keyk into one ofm\\nslots by taking the remainder ofk divided bym. That is, the hash function is\\nh.k/ Dk mod m :\\nFor example, if the hash table has sizem D12 and the key isk D100, then\\nh.k/ D4. Since it requires only a single division operation, hashing by division is\\nquite fast.\\nWhen using the division method, we usually avoid certain values ofm. For\\nexample, m should not be a power of2, since ifm D2p , thenh.k/ is just thep\\nlowest-order bits ofk.

Any ﬁxed hash function is vulnerable to such terrible\\nworst-case behavior; the only effective way to improve the situation is to choose\\nthe hash functionrandomly in a way that isindependent of the keys that are actually\\ngoing to be stored. This approach, calleduniversal hashing, can yield provably\\ngood performance on average, no matter which keys the adversary chooses.\\nIn universal hashing, at the beginning of execution we select the hash function\\nat random from a carefully designed class of functions. As in the case of quick-\\nsort, randomization guarantees that no single input will always evoke worst-case\\nbehavior. Because we randomly select the hash function, the algorithm can be-\\nhave differently on each execution, even for the same input, guaranteeing good\\naverage-case performance for any input. Returning to the example of a compiler’s\\nsymbol table, we ﬁnd that the programmer’s choice of identiﬁers cannot now cause\\nconsistently poor hashing performance. Poor performance occurs only when the\\ncompiler chooses a random hash function that causes the set of identiﬁers to hash\\npoorly, but the probability of this situation occurring is small and is the same for\\nany set of identiﬁers of the same size.\\nLet H be a ﬁnite collection of hash functions that map a given universeU of\\nkeys into the rangef0; 1; : : : ; m /NUL 1g. Such a collection is said to beuniversal\\nif for each pair of distinct keysk; l 2U , the number of hash functionsh 2H\\nfor whichh.k/ Dh.l / is at mostjH j=m.

Long runs of occupied slots tend to get longer,\\nand the average search time increases.\\nQuadraticprobing\\nQuadratic probinguses a hash function of the form\\nh.k; i / D.h0 .k/ Cc1i Cc2i 2/ mod m ; (11.5)\\nwhere h0 is an auxiliary hash function,c1 and c2 are positive auxiliary constants,\\nand i D0; 1; : : : ; m /NUL 1. The initial position probed isT Œh 0 .k/\\x8d; later positions\\nprobed are offset by amounts that depend in a quadratic manner on the probe num-\\nber i . This method works much better than linear probing, but to make full use of\\nthe hash table, the values ofc1, c2, andm are constrained. Problem 11-3 shows\\none way to select these parameters. Also, if two keys have the same initial probe\\nposition, then their probe sequences are the same, sinceh.k1 ; 0/ Dh.k2; 0/ im-\\nplies h.k1 ; i / Dh.k2 ; i / . This property leads to a milder form of clustering, called\\nsecondary clustering. As in linear probing, the initial probe determines the entire\\nsequence, and so onlym distinct probe sequences are used.\\nDoublehashing\\nDouble hashing offers one of the best methods available for open addressing be-\\ncause the permutations produced have many of the characteristics of randomly\\nchosen permutations.Doublehashing uses a hash function of the form\\nh.k; i / D.h1.k/ Ci h2.k// mod m ;\\nwhere bothh1 and h2 are auxiliary hash functions. The initial probe goes to posi-\\ntion T Œh 1.k/\\x8d; successive probe positions are offset from previous positions by the'),\n",

The following procedure returns the successor of a\\nnode x in a binary search tree if it exists, andNIL if x has the largest key in the\\ntree:\\nTREE -SUCCESSOR .x/\\n1 ifx: right ¤NIL\\n2 returnTREE -MINIMUM .x: right/\\n3 y Dx: p\\n4 whiley ¤NIL and x == y: right\\n5 x Dy\\n6 y Dy: p\\n7 returny\\nWe break the code for TREE -SUCCESSOR into two cases. If the right subtree\\nof node x is nonempty, then the successor ofx is just the leftmost node inx’s\\nright subtree, which we ﬁnd in line 2 by calling TREE -MINIMUM .x: right/. For\\nexample, the successor of the node with key15 in Figure 12.2 is the node with\\nkey 17.\\nOn the other hand, as Exercise 12.2-6 asks you to show, if the right subtree of\\nnode x is empty andx has a successory, theny is the lowest ancestor ofx whose\\nleft child is also an ancestor ofx. In Figure 12.2, the successor of the node with\\nkey 13 is the node with key15.

Binary search trees seem to have been independently discovered\\nby a number of people in the late 1950s. Radix trees are often called “tries,” which\\ncomes from the middle letters in the wordretrieval. Knuth [211] also discusses\\nthem.\\nMany texts, including the ﬁrst two editions of this book, have a somewhat sim-\\npler method of deleting a node from a binary search tree when both of its children\\nare present. Instead of replacing node´ by its successory, we delete nodey but\\ncopy its key and satellite data into node´. The downside of this approach is that\\nthe node actually deleted might not be the node passed to the delete procedure. If\\nother components of a program maintain pointers to nodes in the tree, they could\\nmistakenly end up with “stale” pointers to nodes that have been deleted. Although\\nthe deletion method presented in this edition of this book is a bit more complicated,\\nit guarantees that a call to delete node´ deletes node´ and only node´.\\nSection 15.5 will show how to construct an optimal binary search tree when\\nwe know the search frequencies before constructing the tree. That is, given the\\nfrequencies of searching for each key and the frequencies of searching for values\\nthat fall between keys in the tree, we construct a binary search tree for which a\\nset of searches that follows these frequencies examines the minimum number of\\nnodes.\\nThe proof in Section 12.4 that bounds the expected height of a randomly built\\nbinary search tree is due to Aslam [24]. Mart´ ınez and Roura [243] give randomized\\nalgorithms for insertion into and deletion from binary search trees in which the\\nresult of either operation is a random binary search tree. Their deﬁnition of a\\nrandom binary search tree differs—only slightly—from that of a randomly built\\nbinary search tree in this chapter, however.'),\n",

For a red-black\\ntree T , the sentinelT: nil is an object with the same attributes as an ordinary node\\nin the tree. Itscolor attribute is BLACK , and its other attributes—p, left, right,\\nand key—can take on arbitrary values. As Figure 13.1(b) shows, all pointers toNIL\\nare replaced by pointers to the sentinelT: nil.\\nWe use the sentinel so that we can treat aNIL child of a nodex as an ordinary\\nnode whose parent isx. Although we instead could add a distinct sentinel node\\nfor each NIL in the tree, so that the parent of eachNIL is well deﬁned, that ap-\\nproach would waste space. Instead, we use the one sentinelT: nil to represent all\\nthe NIL s—all leaves and the root’s parent. The values of the attributesp, left, right,\\nand key of the sentinel are immaterial, although we may set them during the course\\nof a procedure for our convenience.\\nWe generally conﬁne our interest to the internal nodes of a red-black tree, since\\nthey hold the key values.

If\\nthe height ofx is 0, thenx must be a leaf (T: nil), and the subtree rooted atx indeed\\ncontains at least2bh.x/ /NUL 1 D20 /NUL 1 D0 internal nodes. For the inductive step,\\nconsider a nodex that has positive height and is an internal node with two children.\\nEach child has a black-height of either bh.x/ or bh.x/ /NUL 1, depending on whether\\nits color is red or black, respectively. Since the height of a child ofx is less than\\nthe height ofx itself, we can apply the inductive hypothesis to conclude that each\\nchild has at least2bh.x//NUL 1 /NUL 1 internal nodes. Thus, the subtree rooted atx contains\\nat least.2bh.x//NUL 1 /NUL 1/ C.2bh.x//NUL 1 /NUL 1/ C1 D2bh.x/ /NUL 1 internal nodes, which proves\\nthe claim.\\nTo complete the proof of the lemma, leth be the height of the tree.

First, we shall determine what violations of\\nthe red-black properties are introduced in RB-INSERT when node ´ is inserted\\nand colored red. Second, we shall examine the overall goal of thewhile loop in\\nlines 1–15. Finally, we shall explore each of the three cases1 within the while\\nloop’s body and see how they accomplish the goal. Figure 13.4 shows how RB-\\nINSERT-FIXUP operates on a sample red-black tree.\\nWhich of the red-black properties might be violated upon the call to RB-\\nINSERT-FIXUP ? Property 1 certainly continues to hold, as does property 3, since\\nboth children of the newly inserted red node are the sentinelT: nil. Property 5,\\nwhich says that the number of black nodes is the same on every simple path from\\na given node, is satisﬁed as well, because node´ replaces the (black) sentinel, and\\nnode ´ is red with sentinel children. Thus, the only properties that might be vi-\\nolated are property 2, which requires the root to be black, and property 4, which\\nsays that a red node cannot have a red child. Both possible violations are due to´\\nbeing colored red. Property 2 is violated if´ is the root, and property 4 is violated\\nif ´’s parent is red. Figure 13.4(a) shows a violation of property 4 after the node´\\nhas been inserted.\\n1Case 2 falls through into case 3, and so these two cases are not mutually exclusive.'),\n",

Deleting a node from a red-black tree is a bit more complicated than\\ninserting a node.\\nThe procedure for deleting a node from a red-black tree is based on the TREE -\\nDELETE procedure (Section 12.3). First, we need to customize the TRANSPLANT\\nsubroutine that TREE -DELETE calls so that it applies to a red-black tree:\\nRB-T RANSPLANT .T; u; \\x17/\\n1 ifu: p == T: nil\\n2 T: root D\\x17\\n3 elseifu == u: p: left\\n4 u: p: left D\\x17\\n5 elseu: p: right D\\x17\\n6 \\x17: p Du: p\\nThe procedure RB-TRANSPLANT differs from TRANSPLANT in two ways. First,\\nline 1 references the sentinelT: nil instead ofNIL . Second, the assignment to\\x17: p in\\nline 6 occurs unconditionally: we can assign to\\x17: p even if\\x17 points to the sentinel.\\nIn fact, we shall exploit the ability to assign to\\x17: p when \\x17 DT: nil.\\nThe procedure RB-DELETE is like the TREE -DELETE procedure, but with ad-\\nditional lines of pseudocode. Some of the additional lines keep track of a nodey\\nthat might cause violations of the red-black properties. When we want to delete\\nnode ´ and ´ has fewer than two children, then´ is removed from the tree, and we\\nwant y to be´. When ´ has two children, theny should be´’s successor, andy\\nmoves into´’s position in the tree. We also remembery’s color before it is re-\\nmoved from or moved within the tree, and we keep track of the nodex that moves\\ninto y’s original position in the tree, because nodex might also cause violations\\nof the red-black properties. After deleting node´, RB-DELETE calls an auxiliary\\nprocedure RB-DELETE -FIXUP , which changes colors and performs rotations to\\nrestore the red-black properties.'),\n",

(Observe that when RB-TRANSPLANT\\nis called in lines 5, 8, or 14, the third parameter passed is the same asx.)\\nWhen y’s original parent is´, however, we do not wantx: p to point toy’s orig-\\ninal parent, since we are removing that node from the tree. Because nodey will\\nmove up to take´’s position in the tree, settingx: p to y in line 13 causesx: p\\nto point to the original position ofy’s parent, even ifx DT: nil.\\n\\x0f Finally, if nodey was black, we might have introduced one or more violations\\nof the red-black properties, and so we call RB-DELETE -FIXUP in line 22 to\\nrestore the red-black properties. Ify was red, the red-black properties still hold\\nwhen y is removed or moved, for the following reasons:\\n1. No black-heights in the tree have changed.\\n2. No red nodes have been made adjacent. Becausey takes ´’s place in the\\ntree, along with´’s color, we cannot have two adjacent red nodes aty’s new\\nposition in the tree. In addition, ify was not´’s right child, theny’s original\\nright childx replaces y in the tree. Ify is red, thenx must be black, and so\\nreplacing y by x cannot cause two red nodes to become adjacent.\\n3. Sincey could not have been the root if it was red, the root remains black.\\nIf nodey was black, three problems may arise, which the call of RB-DELETE -\\nFIXUP will remedy. First, ify had been the root and a red child ofy becomes the\\nnew root, we have violated property 2. Second, if bothx and x: p are red, then\\nwe have violated property 4. Third, movingy within the tree causes any simple\\npath that previously containedy to have one fewer black node. Thus, property 5\\nis now violated by any ancestor ofy in the tree. We can correct the violation\\nof property 5 by saying that nodex, now occupyingy’s original position, has an\\n“extra” black. That is, if we add1 to the count of black nodes on any simple path\\nthat containsx, then under this interpretation, property 5 holds. When we remove\\nor move the black nodey, we “push” its blackness onto nodex. The problem is\\nthat now nodex is neither red nor black, thereby violating property 1. Instead,'),\n",

We\\ndetermine in line 2 whetherx is a left child or a right child of its parentx: p. (We\\nhave given the code for the situation in whichx is a left child; the situation in\\nwhich x is a right child—line 22—is symmetric.) We maintain a pointerw to\\nthe sibling ofx. Since nodex is doubly black, nodew cannot beT: nil, because\\notherwise, the number of blacks on the simple path fromx: p to the (singly black)\\nleaf w would be smaller than the number on the simple path fromx: p to x.\\nThe four cases2 in the code appear in Figure 13.7. Before examining each case\\nin detail, let’s look more generally at how we can verify that the transformation\\nin each of the cases preserves property 5. The key idea is that in each case, the\\ntransformation applied preserves the number of black nodes (includingx’s extra\\nblack) from (and including) the root of the subtree shown to each of the subtrees\\n˛; ˇ; : : : ; \\x10 . Thus, if property 5 holds prior to the transformation, it continues to\\nhold afterward. For example, in Figure 13.7(a), which illustrates case 1, the num-\\nber of black nodes from the root to either subtree˛ or ˇ is 3, both before and after\\nthe transformation. (Again, remember that nodex adds an extra black.) Similarly,\\nthe number of black nodes from the root to any of\\r , ı, \", and \\x10 is 2, both be-\\nfore and after the transformation. In Figure 13.7(b), the counting must involve the\\nvalue c of thecolor attribute of the root of the subtree shown, which can be either\\nRED or BLACK . If we deﬁne count.RED / D0 and count.BLACK / D1, then the\\nnumber of black nodes from the root to˛ is 2 Ccount.c/, both before and after\\nthe transformation. In this case, after the transformation, the new nodex has color\\nattribute c, but this node is really either red-and-black (ifc DRED ) or doubly black\\n(if c DBLACK ). You can verify the other cases similarly (see Exercise 13.4-5).\\nCase1: x’ssibling w isred\\nCase 1 (lines 5–8 of RB-DELETE -FIXUP and Figure 13.7(a)) occurs when nodew,\\nthe sibling of nodex, is red. Sincew must have black children, we can switch the\\ncolors ofw and x: p and then perform a left-rotation onx: p without violating any\\nof the red-black properties. The new sibling ofx, which is one ofw’s children\\nprior to the rotation, is now black, and thus we have converted case 1 into case 2,\\n3, or 4.\\nCases 2, 3, and 4 occur when nodew is black; they are distinguished by the\\ncolors ofw’s children.\\n2As in RB-INSERT -FIXUP , the cases in RB-DELETE -FIXUP are not mutually exclusive.'),\n",

To compensate for removing\\none black fromx and w, we would like to add an extra black tox: p, which was\\noriginally either red or black. We do so by repeating thewhile loop withx: p as\\nthe new nodex. Observe that if we enter case 2 through case 1, the new nodex\\nis red-and-black, since the originalx: p was red. Hence, the valuec of thecolor\\nattribute of the new nodex is RED , and the loop terminates when it tests the loop\\ncondition. We then color the new nodex (singly) black in line 23.\\nCase3: x’ssibling w isblack, w’sleftchildisred,and w’srightchildisblack\\nCase 3 (lines 13–16 and Figure 13.7(c)) occurs whenw is black, its left child\\nis red, and its right child is black.

Only in rare situations will you need to cre-\\nate an entirely new type of data structure, though. More often, it will sufﬁce to\\naugment a textbook data structure by storing additional information in it. You can\\nthen program new operations for the data structure to support the desired applica-\\ntion. Augmenting a data structure is not always straightforward, however, since the\\nadded information must be updated and maintained by the ordinary operations on\\nthe data structure.\\nThis chapter discusses two data structures that we construct by augmenting red-\\nblack trees. Section 14.1 describes a data structure that supports general order-\\nstatistic operations on a dynamic set. We can then quickly ﬁnd thei th smallest\\nnumber in a set or the rank of a given element in the total ordering of the set.\\nSection 14.2 abstracts the process of augmenting a data structure and provides a\\ntheorem that can simplify the process of augmenting red-black trees. Section 14.3\\nuses this theorem to help design a data structure for maintaining a dynamic set of\\nintervals, such as time intervals. Given a query interval, we can then quickly ﬁnd\\nan interval in the set that overlaps it.\\n14.1 Dynamicorderstatistics\\nChapter 9 introduced the notion of an order statistic.

We saw how to determine any order statistic inO.n/\\ntime from an unordered set. In this section, we shall see how to modify red-black\\ntrees so that we can determine any order statistic for a dynamic set inO.lg n/ time.\\nWe shall also see how to compute therankof an element—its position in the linear\\norder of the set—inO.lg n/ time.'),\n",

Besides the usual red-black tree attributesx: key, x: color, x: p,\\nx: left, and x: right in a nodex, we have another attribute,x: size. This attribute\\ncontains the number of (internal) nodes in the subtree rooted atx (including x\\nitself), that is, the size of the subtree. If we deﬁne the sentinel’s size to be0—that\\nis, we setT: nil: size to be0—then we have the identity\\nx: size Dx: left: size Cx: right: size C1 :\\nWe do not require keys to be distinct in an order-statistic tree. (For example, the\\ntree in Figure 14.1 has two keys with value 14 and two keys with value 21.) In the\\npresence of equal keys, the above notion of rank is not well deﬁned. We remove\\nthis ambiguity for an order-statistic tree by deﬁning the rank of an element as the\\nposition at which it would be printed in an inorder walk of the tree. In Figure 14.1,\\nfor example, the key 14 stored in a black node has rank 5, and the key 14 stored in\\na red node has rank 6.\\nRetrievinganelementwithagivenrank\\nBefore we show how to maintain this size information during insertion and dele-\\ntion, let us examine the implementation of two order-statistic queries that use this\\nadditional information. We begin with an operation that retrieves an element with\\na given rank. The procedure OS-SELECT .x; i / returns a pointer to the node con-\\ntaining thei th smallest key in the subtree rooted atx.

We can think of nodex’s rank as the number of\\nnodes precedingx in an inorder tree walk, plus 1 forx itself.

Setting y Dx in line 2 makes the invariant true the\\nﬁrst time the test in line 3 executes.\\nMaintenance: At the end of each iteration of thewhile loop, we sety Dy: p.\\nThus we must show that ifr is the rank ofx: key in the subtree rooted aty at the\\nstart of the loop body, thenr is the rank ofx: key in the subtree rooted aty: p\\nat the end of the loop body. In each iteration of thewhile loop, we consider\\nthe subtree rooted aty: p.

We shall now show how to maintain subtree sizes for both\\ninsertion and deletion without affecting the asymptotic running time of either op-\\neration.\\nWe noted in Section 13.3 that insertion into a red-black tree consists of two\\nphases. The ﬁrst phase goes down the tree from the root, inserting the new node\\nas a child of an existing node. The second phase goes up the tree, changing colors\\nand performing rotations to maintain the red-black properties.\\nTo maintain the subtree sizes in the ﬁrst phase, we simply incrementx: size for\\neach nodex on the simple path traversed from the root down toward the leaves. The\\nnew node added gets asize of 1. Since there areO.lg n/ nodes on the traversed\\npath, the additional cost of maintaining thesize attributes isO.lg n/.\\nIn the second phase, the only structural changes to the underlying red-black tree\\nare caused by rotations, of which there are at most two.

(See Section 13.4.) The ﬁrst phase\\neither removes one nodey from the tree or moves upward it within the tree.

For\\nstep 1, we chose red-black trees as the underlying data structure. A clue to the\\nsuitability of red-black trees comes from their efﬁcient support of other dynamic-\\nset operations on a total order, such as MINIMUM , MAXIMUM , SUCCESSOR , and\\nPREDECESSOR .\\nFor step 2, we added thesize attribute, in which each nodex stores the size of the\\nsubtree rooted atx. Generally, the additional information makes operations more\\nefﬁcient. For example, we could have implemented OS-SELECT and OS-RANK\\nusing just the keys stored in the tree, but they would not have run inO.lg n/ time.\\nSometimes, the additional information is pointer information rather than data, as\\nin Exercise 14.2-1.\\nFor step 3, we ensured that insertion and deletion could maintain thesize at-\\ntributes while still running inO.lg n/ time. Ideally, we should need to update only\\na few elements of the data structure in order to maintain the additional information.\\nFor example, if we simply stored in each node its rank in the tree, the OS-SELECT\\nand OS-RANK procedures would run quickly, but inserting a new minimum ele-\\nment would cause a change to this information in every node of the tree. When we\\nstore subtree sizes instead, inserting a new element causes information to change\\nin onlyO.lg n/ nodes.\\nFor step 4, we developed the operations OS-SELECT and OS-RANK . After all,\\nthe need for new operations is why we bother to augment a data structure in the ﬁrst\\nplace. Occasionally, rather than developing new operations, we use the additional\\ninformation to expedite existing ones, as in Exercise 14.2-1.\\nAugmentingred-blacktrees\\nWhen red-black trees underlie an augmented data structure, we can prove that in-\\nsertion and deletion can always efﬁciently maintain certain kinds of additional in-\\nformation, thereby making step 3 very easy. The proof of the following theorem is\\nsimilar to the argument from Section 14.1 that we can maintain thesize attribute\\nfor order-statistic trees.\\nTheorem14.1(Augmentingared-black tree)\\nLet f be an attribute that augments a red-black treeT of n nodes, and suppose that\\nthe value off for each nodex depends on only the information in nodesx, x: left,\\nand x: right, possibly includingx: left: f and x: right: f . Then, we can maintain the\\nvalues off in all nodes ofT during insertion and deletion without asymptotically\\naffecting theO.lg n/ performance of these operations.\\nProof The main idea of the proof is that a change to anf attribute in a nodex\\npropagates only to ancestors ofx in the tree.

Once we have updated\\nT: root: f , no other node will depend on the new value, and so the process termi-\\nnates. Since the height of a red-black tree isO.lg n/, changing anf attribute in a\\nnode costsO.lg n/ time in updating all nodes that depend on the change.\\nInsertion of a nodex into T consists of two phases. (See Section 13.3.) The\\nﬁrst phase insertsx as a child of an existing nodex: p. We can compute the value\\nof x: f in O.1/ time since, by supposition, it depends only on information in the\\nother attributes ofx itself and the information inx’s children, butx’s children are\\nboth the sentinelT: nil. Once we have computedx: f , the change propagates up\\nthe tree. Thus, the total time for the ﬁrst phase of insertion isO.lg n/. During the\\nsecond phase, the only structural changes to the tree come from rotations. Since\\nonly two nodes change in a rotation, the total time for updating thef attributes\\nis O.lg n/ per rotation. Since the number of rotations during insertion is at most\\ntwo, the total time for insertion isO.lg n/.\\nLike insertion, deletion has two phases. (See Section 13.4.) In the ﬁrst phase,\\nchanges to the tree occur when the deleted node is removed from the tree. If the\\ndeleted node had two children at the time, then its successor moves into the position\\nof the deleted node. Propagating the updates tof caused by these changes costs\\nat mostO.lg n/, since the changes modify the tree locally. Fixing up the red-black\\ntree during the second phase requires at most three rotations, and each rotation\\nrequires at mostO.lg n/ time to propagate the updates tof . Thus, like insertion,\\nthe total time for deletion isO.lg n/.\\nIn many cases, such as maintaining thesize attributes in order-statistic trees, the\\ncost of updating after a rotation isO.1/, rather than theO.lg n/ derived in the proof\\nof Theorem 14.1.

This time,x: left: max D10 is less thani: low D22, and so the\\nloop continues with the right child ofx as the newx. Because the intervalŒ15; 23\\x8d\\nstored in this node overlapsi , the procedure returns this node.\\nAs an example of an unsuccessful search, suppose we wish to ﬁnd an interval\\nthat overlapsi DŒ11; 14\\x8d in the interval tree of Figure 14.4. We once again be-\\ngin withx as the root. Since the root’s intervalŒ16; 21\\x8d does not overlapi , and\\nsince x: left: max D23 is greater thani: low D11, we go left to the node con-\\ntaining Œ8; 9\\x8d . Interval Œ8; 9\\x8d does not overlapi , andx: left: max D10 is less than\\ni: low D11, and so we go right. (Note that no interval in the left subtree over-\\nlaps i .) IntervalŒ15; 23\\x8d does not overlapi , and its left child isT: nil, so again we\\ngo right, the loop terminates, and we return the sentinelT: nil.\\nTo see why INTERVAL -SEARCH is correct, we must understand why it sufﬁces\\nto examine a single path from the root. The basic idea is that at any nodex,\\nif x: int does not overlapi , the search always proceeds in a safe direction: the\\nsearch will deﬁnitely ﬁnd an overlapping interval if the tree contains one. The\\nfollowing theorem states this property more precisely.\\nTheorem14.2\\nAny execution of INTERVAL -SEARCH .T; i / either returns a node whose interval\\noverlaps i , or it returnsT: nil and the treeT contains no node whose interval over-\\nlaps i .'),\n",

Earlier parts have presented other\\nwidely applicable techniques, such as divide-and-conquer, randomization, and how\\nto solve recurrences. The techniques in this part are somewhat more sophisticated,\\nbut they help us to attack many computational problems. The themes introduced in\\nthis part will recur later in this book.\\nDynamic programming typically applies to optimization problems in which we\\nmake a set of choices in order to arrive at an optimal solution. As we make\\neach choice, subproblems of the same form often arise. Dynamic programming\\nis effective when a given subproblem may arise from more than one partial set of\\nchoices; the key technique is to store the solution to each such subproblem in case it\\nshould reappear. Chapter 15 shows how this simple idea can sometimes transform\\nexponential-time algorithms into polynomial-time algorithms.\\nLike dynamic-programming algorithms, greedy algorithms typically apply to\\noptimization problems in which we make a set of choices in order to arrive at an\\noptimal solution. The idea of a greedy algorithm is to make each choice in a locally\\noptimal manner. A simple example is coin-changing: to minimize the number of\\nU.S. coins needed to make change for a given amount, we can repeatedly select\\nthe largest-denomination coin that is not larger than the amount that remains. A\\ngreedy approach provides an optimal solution for many such problems much more\\nquickly than would a dynamic-programming approach.

(“Programming” in this context refers\\nto a tabular method, not to writing computer code.) As we saw in Chapters 2\\nand 4, divide-and-conquer algorithms partition the problem into disjoint subprob-\\nlems, solve the subproblems recursively, and then combine their solutions to solve\\nthe original problem. In contrast, dynamic programming applies when the subprob-\\nlems overlap—that is, when subproblems share subsubproblems. In this context,\\na divide-and-conquer algorithm does more work than necessary, repeatedly solv-\\ning the common subsubproblems. A dynamic-programming algorithm solves each\\nsubsubproblem just once and then saves its answer in a table, thereby avoiding the\\nwork of recomputing the answer every time it solves each subsubproblem.\\nWe typically apply dynamic programming tooptimizationproblems. Such prob-\\nlems can have many possible solutions. Each solution has a value, and we wish to\\nﬁnd a solution with the optimal (minimum or maximum) value. We call such a\\nsolution an optimal solution to the problem, as opposed tothe optimal solution,\\nsince there may be several solutions that achieve the optimal value.\\nWhen developing a dynamic-programming algorithm, we follow a sequence of\\nfour steps:\\n1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution.\\n2. Recursively deﬁne the value of an optimal solution.\\n3. Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom-up fashion.\\n4. Construct an optimal solution from computed information.\\nSteps 1–3 form the basis of a dynamic-programming solution to a problem. If we\\nneed only the value of an optimal solution, and not the solution itself, then we\\ncan omit step 4. When we do perform step 4, we sometimes maintain additional\\ninformation during step 3 so that we can easily construct an optimal solution.\\nThe sections that follow use the dynamic-programming method to solve some\\noptimization problems.

Dynamic programming thus uses additional memory\\nto save computation time; it serves an example of atime-memory trade-off. The\\nsavings may be dramatic: an exponential-time solution may be transformed into a\\npolynomial-time solution. A dynamic-programming approach runs in polynomial\\ntime when the number ofdistinct subproblems involved is polynomial in the input\\nsize and we can solve each such subproblem in polynomial time.\\nThere are usually two equivalent ways to implement a dynamic-programming\\napproach. We shall illustrate both of them with our rod-cutting example.\\nThe ﬁrst approach istop-down with memoization.2 In this approach, we write\\nthe procedure recursively in a natural manner, but modiﬁed to save the result of\\neach subproblem (usually in an array or hash table). The procedure now ﬁrst checks\\nto see whether it has previously solved this subproblem. If so, it returns the saved\\nvalue, saving further computation at this level; if not, the procedure computes the\\nvalue in the usual manner. We say that the recursive procedure has beenmemoized;\\nit “remembers” what results it has computed previously.\\nThe second approach is thebottom-upmethod. This approach typically depends\\non some natural notion of the “size” of a subproblem, such that solving any par-\\nticular subproblem depends only on solving “smaller” subproblems. We sort the\\nsubproblems by size and solve them in size order, smallest ﬁrst. When solving a\\nparticular subproblem, we have already solved all of the smaller subproblems its\\nsolution depends upon, and we have saved their solutions. We solve each sub-\\nproblem only once, and when we ﬁrst see it, we have already solved all of its\\nprerequisite subproblems.\\nThese two approaches yield algorithms with the same asymptotic running time,\\nexcept in unusual circumstances where the top-down approach does not actually\\nrecurse to examine all possible subproblems. The bottom-up approach often has\\nmuch better constant factors, since it has less overhead for procedure calls.\\nHere is the the pseudocode for the top-down CUT-ROD procedure, with memo-\\nization added:\\nMEMOIZED -CUT-ROD .p; n/\\n1 let r Œ0 : : n\\x8d be a new array\\n2 fori D0 ton\\n3 r Œi \\x8d D/NUL1\\n4 returnMEMOIZED -CUT-ROD-AUX .p; n; r /\\n2This is not a misspelling.

In\\nother words, no subproblem is considered until all of the subproblems it depends\\nupon have been solved.

Construct an optimal solution from computed information.\\nWe shall go through these steps in order, demonstrating clearly how we apply each\\nstep to the problem.\\nStep1: Thestructure ofanoptimalparenthesization\\nFor our ﬁrst step in the dynamic-programming paradigm, we ﬁnd the optimal sub-\\nstructure and then use it to construct an optimal solution to the problem from opti-\\nmal solutions to subproblems. In the matrix-chain multiplication problem, we can\\nperform this step as follows. For convenience, let us adopt the notationAi ::j , where\\ni \\x14j , for the matrix that results from evaluating the productAi Ai C1 \\x01\\x01\\x01Aj . Ob-\\nserve that if the problem is nontrivial, i.e.,i < j , then to parenthesize the product\\nAi Ai C1 \\x01\\x01\\x01Aj , we must split the product betweenAk and AkC1 for some integerk\\nin the rangei \\x14k < j . That is, for some value ofk, we ﬁrst compute the matrices\\nAi ::k and AkC1::j and then multiply them together to produce the ﬁnal productAi ::j .\\nThe cost of parenthesizing this way is the cost of computing the matrixAi ::k , plus\\nthe cost of computingAkC1::j , plus the cost of multiplying them together.\\nThe optimal substructure of this problem is as follows. Suppose that to op-\\ntimally parenthesize Ai Ai C1 \\x01\\x01\\x01Aj , we split the product betweenAk and AkC1.\\nThen the way we parenthesize the “preﬁx” subchainAi Ai C1 \\x01\\x01\\x01Ak within this\\noptimal parenthesization ofAi Ai C1 \\x01\\x01\\x01Aj must be an optimal parenthesization of\\nAi Ai C1 \\x01\\x01\\x01Ak . Why? If there were a less costly way to parenthesizeAi Ai C1 \\x01\\x01\\x01Ak ,\\nthen we could substitute that parenthesization in the optimal parenthesization\\nof Ai Ai C1 \\x01\\x01\\x01Aj to produce another way to parenthesizeAi Ai C1 \\x01\\x01\\x01Aj whose cost\\nwas lower than the optimum: a contradiction. A similar observation holds for how\\nwe parenthesize the subchainAkC1AkC2 \\x01\\x01\\x01Aj in the optimal parenthesization of\\nAi Ai C1 \\x01\\x01\\x01Aj : it must be an optimal parenthesization ofAkC1AkC2 \\x01\\x01\\x01Aj .\\nNow we use our optimal substructure to show that we can construct an optimal\\nsolution to the problem from optimal solutions to subproblems. We have seen that\\nany solution to a nontrivial instance of the matrix-chain multiplication problem\\nrequires us to split the product, and that any optimal solution contains within it op-\\ntimal solutions to subproblem instances. Thus, we can build an optimal solution to\\nan instance of the matrix-chain multiplication problem by splitting the problem into\\ntwo subproblems (optimally parenthesizingAi Ai C1 \\x01\\x01\\x01Ak and AkC1AkC2 \\x01\\x01\\x01Aj ),\\nﬁnding optimal solutions to subproblem instances, and then combining these op-\\ntimal subproblem solutions. We must ensure that when we search for the correct\\nplace to split the product, we have considered all possible places, so that we are\\nsure of having examined the optimal one.'),\n",

For the matrix-chain multiplication problem, we pick as\\nour subproblems the problems of determining the minimum cost of parenthesizing\\nAi Ai C1 \\x01\\x01\\x01Aj for 1 \\x14i \\x14j \\x14n. Let mŒi; j \\x8d be the minimum number of scalar\\nmultiplications needed to compute the matrixAi ::j ; for the full problem, the lowest-\\ncost way to computeA1::n would thus bemŒ1; n\\x8d .\\nWe can deﬁnemŒi; j \\x8d recursively as follows.

Thus,mŒi; i \\x8d D0 for i D1; 2; : : : ; n . To\\ncompute mŒi; j \\x8d when i < j , we take advantage of the structure of an optimal\\nsolution from step 1. Let us assume that to optimally parenthesize, we split the\\nproduct Ai Ai C1 \\x01\\x01\\x01Aj between Ak and AkC1, wherei \\x14k < j . Then, mŒi; j \\x8d\\nequals the minimum cost for computing the subproductsAi ::k and AkC1::j , plus the\\ncost of multiplying these two matrices together. Recalling that each matrixAi is\\npi /NUL 1 \\x02pi , we see that computing the matrix productAi ::k AkC1::j takes pi /NUL 1pk pj\\nscalar multiplications. Thus, we obtain\\nmŒi; j \\x8d DmŒi; k\\x8d CmŒk C1; j \\x8d Cpi /NUL 1pk pj :\\nThis recursive equation assumes that we know the value ofk, which we do not.\\nThere are onlyj /NULi possible values fork, however, namelyk Di; i C1; : : : ; j /NUL1.\\nSince the optimal parenthesization must use one of these values fork, we need only\\ncheck them all to ﬁnd the best.

To\\nhelp us do so, we deﬁnesŒi; j \\x8d to be a value ofk at which we split the product\\nAi Ai C1 \\x01\\x01\\x01Aj in an optimal parenthesization.

We also revisit and discuss more fully\\nhow memoization might help us take advantage of the overlapping-subproblems\\nproperty in a top-down recursive approach.\\nOptimalsubstructure\\nThe ﬁrst step in solving an optimization problem by dynamic programming is to\\ncharacterize the structure of an optimal solution. Recall that a problem exhibits\\noptimal substructureif an optimal solution to the problem contains within it opti-\\nmal solutions to subproblems. Whenever a problem exhibits optimal substructure,\\nwe have a good clue that dynamic programming might apply. (As Chapter 16 dis-\\ncusses, it also might mean that a greedy strategy applies, however.) In dynamic\\nprogramming, we build an optimal solution to the problem from optimal solutions\\nto subproblems. Consequently, we must take care to ensure that the range of sub-\\nproblems we consider includes those used in an optimal solution.\\nWe discovered optimal substructure in both of the problems we have examined\\nin this chapter so far. In Section 15.1, we observed that the optimal way of cut-\\nting up a rod of lengthn (if we make any cuts at all) involves optimally cutting\\nup the two pieces resulting from the ﬁrst cut. In Section 15.2, we observed that\\nan optimal parenthesization ofAi Ai C1 \\x01\\x01\\x01Aj that splits the product betweenAk\\nand AkC1 contains within it optimal solutions to the problems of parenthesizing\\nAi Ai C1 \\x01\\x01\\x01Ak and AkC1AkC2 \\x01\\x01\\x01Aj .\\nYou will ﬁnd yourself following a common pattern in discovering optimal sub-\\nstructure:\\n1. You show that a solution to the problem consists of making a choice, such as\\nchoosing an initial cut in a rod or choosing an index at which to split the matrix\\nchain. Making this choice leaves one or more subproblems to be solved.\\n2. You suppose that for a given problem, you are given the choice that leads to an\\noptimal solution. You do not concern yourself yet with how to determine this\\nchoice. You just assume that it has been given to you.\\n3. Given this choice, you determine which subproblems ensue and how to best\\ncharacterize the resulting space of subproblems.\\n4. You show that the solutions to the subproblems used within an optimal solution\\nto the problem must themselves be optimal by using a “cut-and-paste” tech-\\nnique. You do so by supposing that each of the subproblem solutions is not\\noptimal and then deriving a contradiction. In particular, by “cutting out” the\\nnonoptimal solution to each subproblem and “pasting in” the optimal one, you\\nshow that you can get a better solution to the original problem, thus contradict-\\ning your supposition that you already had an optimal solution.

For example,\\nthe space of subproblems that we considered for the rod-cutting problem contained\\nthe problems of optimally cutting up a rod of lengthi for each sizei . This sub-\\nproblem space worked well, and we had no need to try a more general space of\\nsubproblems.\\nConversely, suppose that we had tried to constrain our subproblem space for\\nmatrix-chain multiplication to matrix products of the formA1A2 \\x01\\x01\\x01Aj . As before,\\nan optimal parenthesization must split this product betweenAk and AkC1 for some\\n1 \\x14k < j . Unless we could guarantee thatk always equalsj /NUL 1, we would ﬁnd\\nthat we had subproblems of the formA1A2 \\x01\\x01\\x01Ak and AkC1AkC2 \\x01\\x01\\x01Aj , and that\\nthe latter subproblem is not of the formA1A2 \\x01\\x01\\x01Aj . For this problem, we needed\\nto allow our subproblems to vary at “both ends,” that is, to allow bothi and j to\\nvary in the subproblemAi Ai C1 \\x01\\x01\\x01Aj .\\nOptimal substructure varies across problem domains in two ways:\\n1. how many subproblems an optimal solution to the original problem uses, and\\n2. how many choices we have in determining which subproblem(s) to use in an\\noptimal solution.\\nIn the rod-cutting problem, an optimal solution for cutting up a rod of sizen\\nuses just one subproblem (of sizen /NUL i ), but we must considern choices for i\\nin order to determine which one yields an optimal solution. Matrix-chain mul-\\ntiplication for the subchainAi Ai C1 \\x01\\x01\\x01Aj serves as an example with two sub-\\nproblems andj /NUL i choices. For a given matrixAk at which we split the prod-\\nuct, we have two subproblems—parenthesizingAi Ai C1 \\x01\\x01\\x01Ak and parenthesizing\\nAkC1AkC2 \\x01\\x01\\x01Aj —and we must solveboth of them optimally. Once we determine\\nthe optimal solutions to subproblems, we choose from amongj /NUL i candidates for\\nthe indexk.\\nInformally, the running time of a dynamic-programming algorithm depends on\\nthe product of two factors: the number of subproblems overall and how many\\nchoices we look at for each subproblem. In rod cutting, we had‚.n/ subproblems\\noverall, and at mostn choices to examine for each, yielding anO.n2 / running time.\\nMatrix-chain multiplication had‚.n2/ subproblems overall, and in each we had at\\nmost n /NUL 1 choices, giving anO.n3/ running time (actually, a‚.n3/ running time,\\nby Exercise 15.2-5).\\nUsually, the subproblem graph gives an alternative way to perform the same\\nanalysis.

Finding an optimal solu-\\ntion to the problem entails making a choice among subproblems as to which we\\nwill use in solving the problem. The cost of the problem solution is usually the\\nsubproblem costs plus a cost that is directly attributable to the choice itself. In\\nrod cutting, for example, ﬁrst we solved the subproblems of determining optimal\\nways to cut up rods of lengthi for i D0; 1; : : : ; n /NUL 1, and then we determined\\nwhich such subproblem yielded an optimal solution for a rod of lengthn, using\\nequation (15.2). The cost attributable to the choice itself is the termpi in equa-\\ntion (15.2).

The cost attributable to the choice itself is the termpi /NUL 1pk pj .\\nIn Chapter 16, we shall examine “greedy algorithms,” which have many similar-\\nities to dynamic programming. In particular, problems to which greedy algorithms\\napply have optimal substructure. One major difference between greedy algorithms\\nand dynamic programming is that instead of ﬁrst ﬁnding optimal solutions to sub-\\nproblems and then making an informed choice, greedy algorithms ﬁrst make a\\n“greedy” choice—the choice that looks best at the time—and then solve a resulting\\nsubproblem, without bothering to solve all possible related smaller subproblems.\\nSurprisingly, in some cases this strategy works!\\nSubtleties\\nYou should be careful not to assume that optimal substructure applies when it does\\nnot.

We need to include the requirement of simplicity because other-\\nwise we can traverse a cycle as many times as we like to create paths with an\\narbitrarily large number of edges.\\nThe unweighted shortest-path problem exhibits optimal substructure, as follows.\\nSuppose thatu ¤\\x17, so that the problem is nontrivial. Then, any pathp from u\\nto \\x17 must contain an intermediate vertex, sayw. (Note that w may be u or \\x17.)\\nThus, we can decompose the pathu\\np\\n; \\x17 into subpathsu\\np1\\n; w\\np2\\n; \\x17. Clearly, the\\nnumber of edges inp equals the number of edges inp1 plus the number of edges\\nin p2. We claim that ifp is an optimal (i.e., shortest) path fromu to \\x17, thenp1\\nmust be a shortest path fromu to w. Why? We use a “cut-and-paste” argument:\\nif there were another path, sayp0\\n1 , fromu to w with fewer edges thanp1, then we\\ncould cut outp1 and paste inp0\\n1 to produce a pathu\\np0\\n1\\n; w\\np2\\n; \\x17 with fewer edges\\nthan p, thus contradictingp’s optimality. Symmetrically,p2 must be a shortest\\npath fromw to \\x17. Thus, we can ﬁnd a shortest path fromu to \\x17 by considering\\nall intermediate verticesw, ﬁnding a shortest path fromu to w and a shortest path\\nfrom w to \\x17, and choosing an intermediate vertexw that yields the overall shortest\\npath. In Section 25.2, we use a variant of this observation of optimal substructure\\nto ﬁnd a shortest path between every pair of vertices on a weighted, directed graph.\\nYou might be tempted to assume that the problem of ﬁnding an unweighted\\nlongest simple path exhibits optimal substructure as well. After all, if we decom-\\npose a longest simple pathu\\np\\n; \\x17 into subpathsu\\np1\\n; w\\np2\\n; \\x17, then mustn’tp1\\nbe a longest simple path fromu to w, and mustn’tp2 be a longest simple path\\nfrom w to \\x17? The answer is no! Figure 15.6 supplies an example. Consider the\\npath q !r !t , which is a longest simple path fromq to t . Is q !r a longest\\nsimple path fromq to r ? No, for the pathq !s !t !r is a simple path\\nthat is longer. Isr !t a longest simple path fromr to t ? No again, for the path\\nr !q !s !t is a simple path that is longer.'),\n",

If we combine the longest simple\\npaths q !s !t !r and r !q !s !t , we get the pathq !s !t !r !\\nq !s !t , which is not simple. Indeed, the problem of ﬁnding an unweighted\\nlongest simple path does not appear to have any sort of optimal substructure. No\\nefﬁcient dynamic-programming algorithm for this problem has ever been found. In\\nfact, this problem is NP-complete, which—as we shall see in Chapter 34—means\\nthat we are unlikely to ﬁnd a way to solve it in polynomial time.\\nWhy is the substructure of a longest simple path so different from that of a short-\\nest path? Although a solution to a problem for both longest and shortest paths uses\\ntwo subproblems, the subproblems in ﬁnding the longest simple path are notinde-\\npendent, whereas for shortest paths they are. What do we mean by subproblems\\nbeing independent? We mean that the solution to one subproblem does not affect\\nthe solution to another subproblem of the same problem. For the example of Fig-\\nure 15.6, we have the problem of ﬁnding a longest simple path fromq to t with two\\nsubproblems: ﬁnding longest simple paths fromq to r and fromr to t . For the ﬁrst\\nof these subproblems, we choose the pathq !s !t !r , and so we have also\\nused the verticess and t . We can no longer use these vertices in the second sub-\\nproblem, since the combination of the two solutions to subproblems would yield a\\npath that is not simple. If we cannot use vertext in the second problem, then we\\ncannot solve it at all, sincet is required to be on the path that we ﬁnd, and it is\\nnot the vertex at which we are “splicing” together the subproblem solutions (that\\nvertex beingr ). Because we use verticess and t in one subproblem solution, we\\ncannot use them in the other subproblem solution. We must use at least one of them\\nto solve the other subproblem, however, and we must use both of them to solve it\\noptimally. Thus, we say that these subproblems are not independent. Looked at\\nanother way, using resources in solving one subproblem (those resources being\\nvertices) renders them unavailable for the other subproblem.\\nWhy, then, are the subproblems independent for ﬁnding a shortest path? The\\nanswer is that by nature, the subproblems do not share resources. We claim that\\nif a vertexw is on a shortest pathp from u to \\x17, then we can splice togetherany\\nshortest pathu\\np1\\n; w and any shortest pathw\\np2\\n; \\x17 to produce a shortest path fromu\\nto \\x17. We are assured that, other thanw, no vertex can appear in both pathsp1\\nand p2. Why? Suppose that some vertexx ¤w appears in bothp1 and p2, so that\\nwe can decomposep1 as u\\npux\\n; x ; w and p2 as w ; x\\npx\\x17\\n; \\x17. By the optimal\\nsubstructure of this problem, pathp has as many edges asp1 and p2 together; let’s\\nsay thatp has e edges. Now let us construct a pathp0 Du\\npux\\n; x\\npx\\x17\\n; \\x17 from u to \\x17.\\nBecause we have excised the paths fromx to w and fromw to x, each of which\\ncontains at least one edge, pathp0 contains at moste /NUL 2 edges, which contradicts'),\n",

Thus, we are assured that the subproblems\\nfor the shortest-path problem are independent.\\nBoth problems examined in Sections 15.1 and 15.2 have independent subprob-\\nlems. In matrix-chain multiplication, the subproblems are multiplying subchains\\nAi Ai C1 \\x01\\x01\\x01Ak and AkC1AkC2 \\x01\\x01\\x01Aj . These subchains are disjoint, so that no ma-\\ntrix could possibly be included in both of them. In rod cutting, to determine the\\nbest way to cut up a rod of lengthn, we look at the best ways of cutting up rods\\nof lengthi for i D0; 1; : : : ; n /NUL 1. Because an optimal solution to the length-n\\nproblem includes just one of these subproblem solutions (after we have cut off the\\nﬁrst piece), independence of subproblems is not an issue.\\nOverlappingsubproblems\\nThe second ingredient that an optimization problem must have for dynamic pro-\\ngramming to apply is that the space of subproblems must be “small” in the sense\\nthat a recursive algorithm for the problem solves the same subproblems over and\\nover, rather than always generating new subproblems. Typically, the total number\\nof distinct subproblems is a polynomial in the input size. When a recursive algo-\\nrithm revisits the same problem repeatedly, we say that the optimization problem\\nhas overlapping subproblems.4 In contrast, a problem for which a divide-and-\\nconquer approach is suitable usually generates brand-new problems at each step\\nof the recursion. Dynamic-programming algorithms typically take advantage of\\noverlapping subproblems by solving each subproblem once and then storing the\\nsolution in a table where it can be looked up when needed, using constant time per\\nlookup.\\nIn Section 15.1, we brieﬂy examined how a recursive solution to rod cut-\\nting makes exponentially many calls to ﬁnd solutions of smaller subproblems.\\nOur dynamic-programming solution takes an exponential-time recursive algorithm\\ndown to quadratic time.\\nTo illustrate the overlapping-subproblems property in greater detail, let us re-\\nexamine the matrix-chain multiplication problem. Referring back to Figure 15.5,\\nobserve that MATRIX -CHAIN -ORDER repeatedly looks up the solution to subprob-\\nlems in lower rows when solving subproblems in higher rows. For example, it\\nreferences entrymŒ3; 4\\x8d four times: during the computations ofmŒ2; 4\\x8d , mŒ1; 4\\x8d ,\\n4It may seem strange that dynamic programming relies on subproblems being both independent\\nand overlapping. Although these requirements may sound contradictory, they describe two different\\nnotions, rather than two points on the same axis. Two subproblems of the same problem are inde-\\npendent if they do not share resources. Two subproblems are overlapping if they are really the same\\nsubproblem that occurs as a subproblem of different problems.'),\n",

For example, the DNA of one organism may be\\nS1 DACCGGTCGAGTGCGCGGAAGCCGGCCGAA, and the DNA of another organ-\\nism may beS2 DGTCGTTCGGAATGCCGTTGCTCTGTAAA. One reason to com-\\npare two strands of DNA is to determine how “similar” the two strands are, as some\\nmeasure of how closely related the two organisms are. We can, and do, deﬁne sim-\\nilarity in many different ways. For example, we can say that two DNA strands are\\nsimilar if one is a substring of the other. (Chapter 32 explores algorithms to solve\\nthis problem.) In our example, neitherS1 nor S2 is a substring of the other. Alter-\\nnatively, we could say that two strands are similar if the number of changes needed\\nto turn one into the other is small. (Problem 15-5 looks at this notion.) Yet another\\nway to measure the similarity of strandsS1 and S2 is by ﬁnding a third strandS3\\nin which the bases inS3 appear in each ofS1 and S2; these bases must appear\\nin the same order, but not necessarily consecutively.

Thus, we\\ncan reconstruct an LCS inO.m Cn/ time using a procedure similar to PRINT -LCS.\\n(Exercise 15.4-2 asks you to give the pseudocode.) Although we save‚.mn/ space\\nby this method, the auxiliary space requirement for computing an LCS does not\\nasymptotically decrease, since we need‚.mn/ space for thec table anyway.\\nWe can, however, reduce the asymptotic space requirements for LCS-LENGTH ,\\nsince it needs only two rows of tablec at a time: the row being computed and the\\nprevious row.

We could ensure anO.lg n/\\nsearch time per occurrence by using a red-black tree or any other balanced binary\\nsearch tree. Words appear with different frequencies, however, and a frequently\\nused word such asthe may appear far from the root while a rarely used word such\\nas machicolation appears near the root. Such an organization would slow down the\\ntranslation, since the number of nodes visited when searching for a key in a binary\\nsearch tree equals one plus the depth of the node containing the key. We want\\nwords that occur frequently in the text to be placed nearer the root.6 Moreover,\\nsome words in the text might have no French translation,7 and such words would\\nnot appear in the binary search tree at all. How do we organize a binary search tree\\nso as to minimize the number of nodes visited in all searches, given that we know\\nhow often each word occurs?\\nWhat we need is known as anoptimal binary search tree.

Given keys\\nki ; : : : ; k j , one of these keys, saykr (i \\x14 r \\x14 j ), is the root of an optimal\\nsubtree containing these keys. The left subtree of the rootkr contains the keys\\nki ; : : : ; k r /NUL 1 (and dummy keysdi /NUL 1; : : : ; d r /NUL 1 ), and the right subtree contains the\\nkeys kr C1; : : : ; k j (and dummy keysdr ; : : : ; d j ).

Suppose that in a\\nsubtree with keyski ; : : : ; k j , we selectki as the root. By the above argument,ki ’s\\nleft subtree contains the keyski ; : : : ; k i /NUL 1 . We interpret this sequence as containing\\nno keys. Bear in mind, however, that subtrees also contain dummy keys. We adopt\\nthe convention that a subtree containing keyski ; : : : ; k i /NUL 1 has no actual keys but\\ndoes contain the single dummy keydi /NUL 1. Symmetrically, if we selectkj as the root,\\nthen kj ’s right subtree contains the keyskj C1; : : : ; k j ; this right subtree contains\\nno actual keys, but it does contain the dummy keydj .\\nStep2: Arecursive solution\\nWe are ready to deﬁne the value of an optimal solution recursively. We pick our\\nsubproblem domain as ﬁnding an optimal binary search tree containing the keys\\nki ; : : : ; k j , where i \\x15 1, j \\x14 n, and j \\x15 i /NUL 1. (When j D i /NUL 1, there\\nare no actual keys; we have just the dummy keydi /NUL 1.) Let us deﬁneeŒi; j \\x8d as\\nthe expected cost of searching an optimal binary search tree containing the keys\\nki ; : : : ; k j .

What happens to the\\nexpected search cost of a subtree when it becomes a subtree of a node? The depth\\nof each node in the subtree increases by 1. By equation (15.11), the expected search\\ncost of this subtree increases by the sum of all the probabilities in the subtree.

If she programs the\\nbreaks to occur in left-to-right order, then the ﬁrst break costs20 time units, the\\nsecond break costs18 time units (breaking the string from characters3 to 20 at\\ncharacter 8), and the third break costs12 time units, totaling50 time units. If she\\nprograms the breaks to occur in right-to-left order, however, then the ﬁrst break\\ncosts 20 time units, the second break costs10 time units, and the third break costs\\n8 time units, totaling38 time units. In yet another order, she could break ﬁrst at8\\n(costing 20), then break the left piece at2 (costing 8), and ﬁnally the right piece\\nat 10 (costing 12), for a total cost of40.\\nDesign an algorithm that, given the numbers of characters after which to break,\\ndetermines a least-cost way to sequence those breaks.

For many optimization problems, using dynamic\\nprogramming to determine the best choices is overkill; simpler, more efﬁcient al-\\ngorithms will do. Agreedy algorithmalways makes the choice that looks best at\\nthe moment. That is, it makes a locally optimal choice in the hope that this choice\\nwill lead to a globally optimal solution. This chapter explores optimization prob-\\nlems for which greedy algorithms provide optimal solutions. Before reading this\\nchapter, you should read about dynamic programming in Chapter 15, particularly\\nSection 15.3.\\nGreedy algorithms do not always yield optimal solutions, but for many problems\\nthey do. We shall ﬁrst examine, in Section 16.1, a simple but nontrivial problem,\\nthe activity-selection problem, for which a greedy algorithm efﬁciently computes\\nan optimal solution. We shall arrive at the greedy algorithm by ﬁrst consider-\\ning a dynamic-programming approach and then showing that we can always make\\ngreedy choices to arrive at an optimal solution. Section 16.2 reviews the basic\\nelements of the greedy approach, giving a direct approach for proving greedy al-\\ngorithms correct. Section 16.3 presents an important application of greedy tech-\\nniques: designing data-compression (Huffman) codes. In Section 16.4, we inves-\\ntigate some of the theory underlying combinatorial structures called “matroids,”\\nfor which a greedy algorithm always produces an optimal solution. Finally, Sec-\\ntion 16.5 applies matroids to solve a problem of scheduling unit-time tasks with\\ndeadlines and penalties.\\nThe greedy method is quite powerful and works well for a wide range of prob-\\nlems. Later chapters will present many algorithms that we can view as applica-\\ntions of the greedy method, including minimum-spanning-tree algorithms (Chap-\\nter 23), Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest paths from a single source (Chapter 24),\\nand Chv´ atal’s greedy set-covering heuristic (Chapter 35).

That could save us from having to consider all\\nthe choices inherent in recurrence (16.2). In fact, for the activity-selection problem,\\nwe need consider only one choice: the greedy choice.\\nWhat do we mean by the greedy choice for the activity-selection problem? Intu-\\nition suggests that we should choose an activity that leaves the resource available\\nfor as many other activities as possible. Now, of the activities we end up choos-\\ning, one of them must be the ﬁrst one to ﬁnish. Our intuition tells us, therefore,\\nto choose the activity inS with the earliest ﬁnish time, since that would leave the\\nresource available for as many of the activities that follow it as possible. (If more\\nthan one activity inS has the earliest ﬁnish time, then we can choose any such\\nactivity.) In other words, since the activities are sorted in monotonically increasing\\norder by ﬁnish time, the greedy choice is activitya1. Choosing the ﬁrst activity\\nto ﬁnish is not the only way to think of making a greedy choice for this problem;\\nExercise 16.1-3 asks you to explore other possibilities.\\nIf we make the greedy choice, we have only one remaining subproblem to solve:\\nﬁnding activities that start aftera1 ﬁnishes. Why don’t we have to consider ac-\\ntivities that ﬁnish beforea1 starts? We have thats1 < f 1, andf1 is the earliest\\nﬁnish time of any activity, and therefore no activity can have a ﬁnish time less than\\nor equal tos1. Thus, all activities that are compatible with activitya1 must start\\nafter a1 ﬁnishes.\\nFurthermore, we have already established that the activity-selection problem ex-\\nhibits optimal substructure. LetSk Dfai 2S Wsi \\x15fk gbe the set of activities that\\nstart after activityak ﬁnishes. If we make the greedy choice of activitya1, thenS1\\nremains as the only subproblem to solve.1 Optimal substructure tells us that ifa1\\nis in the optimal solution, then an optimal solution to the original problem consists\\nof activitya1 and all the activities in an optimal solution to the subproblemS1.\\nOne big question remains: is our intuition correct? Is the greedy choice—in\\nwhich we choose the ﬁrst activity to ﬁnish—always part of some optimal solution?\\nThe following theorem shows that it is.\\n1We sometimes refer to the setsSk as subproblems rather than as just sets of activities. It will always\\nbe clear from the context whether we are referring toSk as a set of activities or as a subproblem\\nwhose input is that set.'),\n",

At each decision point, the algorithm makes the choice that seems best\\nat the moment. This heuristic strategy does not always produce an optimal solution,\\nbut as we saw in the activity-selection problem, sometimes it does. This section\\ndiscusses some of the general properties of greedy methods.\\nThe process that we followed in Section 16.1 to develop a greedy algorithm was\\na bit more involved than is typical. We went through the following steps:\\n1. Determine the optimal substructure of the problem.\\n2. Develop a recursive solution. (For the activity-selection problem, we formu-\\nlated recurrence (16.2), but we bypassed developing a recursive algorithm based\\non this recurrence.)\\n3. Show that if we make the greedy choice, then only one subproblem remains.\\n4. Prove that it is always safe to make the greedy choice. (Steps 3 and 4 can occur\\nin either order.)\\n5. Develop a recursive algorithm that implements the greedy strategy.\\n6. Convert the recursive algorithm to an iterative algorithm.\\nIn going through these steps, we saw in great detail the dynamic-programming un-\\nderpinnings of a greedy algorithm. For example, in the activity-selection problem,\\nwe ﬁrst deﬁned the subproblemsSi j, where bothi and j varied. We then found\\nthat if we always made the greedy choice, we could restrict the subproblems to be\\nof the formSk .\\nAlternatively, we could have fashioned our optimal substructure with a greedy\\nchoice in mind, so that the choice leaves just one subproblem to solve. In the\\nactivity-selection problem, we could have started by dropping the second subscript\\nand deﬁning subproblems of the formSk . Then, we could have proven that a greedy\\nchoice (the ﬁrst activityam to ﬁnish inSk ), combined with an optimal solution to\\nthe remaining setSm of compatible activities, yields an optimal solution toSk .\\nMore generally, we design greedy algorithms according to the following sequence\\nof steps:\\n1. Cast the optimization problem as one in which we make a choice and are left\\nwith one subproblem to solve.\\n2. Prove that there is always an optimal solution to the original problem that makes\\nthe greedy choice, so that the greedy choice is always safe.'),\n",

Demonstrate optimal substructure by showing that, having made the greedy\\nchoice, what remains is a subproblem with the property that if we combine an\\noptimal solution to the subproblem with the greedy choice we have made, we\\narrive at an optimal solution to the original problem.\\nWe shall use this more direct process in later sections of this chapter. Neverthe-\\nless, beneath every greedy algorithm, there is almost always a more cumbersome\\ndynamic-programming solution.\\nHow can we tell whether a greedy algorithm will solve a particular optimization\\nproblem? No way works all the time, but the greedy-choice property and optimal\\nsubstructure are the two key ingredients. If we can demonstrate that the problem\\nhas these properties, then we are well on the way to developing a greedy algorithm\\nfor it.\\nGreedy-choice property\\nThe ﬁrst key ingredient is thegreedy-choice property: we can assemble a globally\\noptimal solution by making locally optimal (greedy) choices. In other words, when\\nwe are considering which choice to make, we make the choice that looks best in\\nthe current problem, without considering results from subproblems.\\nHere is where greedy algorithms differ from dynamic programming. In dynamic\\nprogramming, we make a choice at each step, but the choice usually depends on the\\nsolutions to subproblems. Consequently, we typically solve dynamic-programming\\nproblems in a bottom-up manner, progressing from smaller subproblems to larger\\nsubproblems. (Alternatively, we can solve them top down, but memoizing. Of\\ncourse, even though the code works top down, we still must solve the subprob-\\nlems before making a choice.) In a greedy algorithm, we make whatever choice\\nseems best at the moment and then solve the subproblem that remains. The choice\\nmade by a greedy algorithm may depend on choices so far, but it cannot depend on\\nany future choices or on the solutions to subproblems. Thus, unlike dynamic pro-\\ngramming, which solves the subproblems before making the ﬁrst choice, a greedy\\nalgorithm makes its ﬁrst choice before solving any subproblems. A dynamic-\\nprogramming algorithm proceeds bottom up, whereas a greedy strategy usually\\nprogresses in a top-down fashion, making one greedy choice after another, reduc-\\ning each given problem instance to a smaller one.\\nOf course, we must prove that a greedy choice at each step yields a globally\\noptimal solution. Typically, as in the case of Theorem 16.1, the proof examines\\na globally optimal solution to some subproblem. It then shows how to modify\\nthe solution to substitute the greedy choice for some other choice, resulting in one\\nsimilar, but smaller, subproblem.\\nWe can usually make the greedy choice more efﬁciently than when we have to\\nconsider a wider set of choices. For example, in the activity-selection problem, as-'),\n",

By preprocessing the\\ninput or by using an appropriate data structure (often a priority queue), we often\\ncan make greedy choices quickly, thus yielding an efﬁcient algorithm.\\nOptimalsubstructure\\nA problem exhibitsoptimal substructureif an optimal solution to the problem\\ncontains within it optimal solutions to subproblems. This property is a key in-\\ngredient of assessing the applicability of dynamic programming as well as greedy\\nalgorithms. As an example of optimal substructure, recall how we demonstrated in\\nSection 16.1 that if an optimal solution to subproblemSi j includes an activityak ,\\nthen it must also contain optimal solutions to the subproblemsSi k and Sk j . Given\\nthis optimal substructure, we argued that if we knew which activity to use asak , we\\ncould construct an optimal solution toSi j by selectingak along with all activities\\nin optimal solutions to the subproblemsSi k and Sk j . Based on this observation of\\noptimal substructure, we were able to devise the recurrence (16.2) that described\\nthe value of an optimal solution.\\nWe usually use a more direct approach regarding optimal substructure when\\napplying it to greedy algorithms. As mentioned above, we have the luxury of\\nassuming that we arrived at a subproblem by having made the greedy choice in\\nthe original problem. All we really need to do is argue that an optimal solution to\\nthe subproblem, combined with the greedy choice already made, yields an optimal\\nsolution to the original problem. This scheme implicitly uses induction on the\\nsubproblems to prove that making the greedy choice at every step produces an\\noptimal solution.\\nGreedyversusdynamicprogramming\\nBecause both the greedy and dynamic-programming strategies exploit optimal sub-\\nstructure, you might be tempted to generate a dynamic-programming solution to a\\nproblem when a greedy solution sufﬁces or, conversely, you might mistakenly think\\nthat a greedy solution works when in fact a dynamic-programming solution is re-\\nquired. To illustrate the subtleties between the two techniques, let us investigate\\ntwo variants of a classical optimization problem.\\nThe 0-1 knapsack problemis the following. A thief robbing a store ﬁndsn\\nitems. Thei th item is worth\\x17i dollars and weighswi pounds, where\\x17i and wi are\\nintegers.

For the 0-1\\nproblem, consider the most valuable load that weighs at mostW pounds. If we\\nremove itemj from this load, the remaining load must be the most valuable load\\nweighing at mostW /NUL wj that the thief can take from then /NUL 1 original items\\nexcluding j . For the comparable fractional problem, consider that if we remove\\na weightw of one itemj from the optimal load, the remaining load must be the\\nmost valuable load weighing at mostW /NUL w that the thief can take from then /NUL 1\\noriginal items pluswj /NUL w pounds of itemj .\\nAlthough the problems are similar, we can solve the fractional knapsack problem\\nby a greedy strategy, but we cannot solve the 0-1 problem by such a strategy. To\\nsolve the fractional problem, we ﬁrst compute the value per pound\\x17i =wi for each\\nitem. Obeying a greedy strategy, the thief begins by taking as much as possible of\\nthe item with the greatest value per pound. If the supply of that item is exhausted\\nand he can still carry more, he takes as much as possible of the item with the next\\ngreatest value per pound, and so forth, until he reaches his weight limitW . Thus,\\nby sorting the items by value per pound, the greedy algorithm runs inO.n lg n/\\ntime. We leave the proof that the fractional knapsack problem has the greedy-\\nchoice property as Exercise 16.2-1.\\nTo see that this greedy strategy does not work for the 0-1 knapsack problem,\\nconsider the problem instance illustrated in Figure 16.2(a). This example has3\\nitems and a knapsack that can hold50 pounds. Item 1 weighs 10 pounds and\\nis worth60 dollars. Item 2 weighs 20 pounds and is worth100 dollars. Item 3\\nweighs 30 pounds and is worth120 dollars. Thus, the value per pound of item1 is\\n6 dollars per pound, which is greater than the value per pound of either item2 (5\\ndollars per pound) or item3 (4 dollars per pound). The greedy strategy, therefore,\\nwould take item1 ﬁrst. As you can see from the case analysis in Figure 16.2(b),\\nhowever, the optimal solution takes items2 and 3, leaving item1 behind. The two\\npossible solutions that take item1 are both suboptimal.\\nFor the comparable fractional problem, however, the greedy strategy, which\\ntakes item1 ﬁrst, does yield an optimal solution, as shown in Figure 16.2(c). Tak-\\ning item1 doesn’t work in the 0-1 problem because the thief is unable to ﬁll his\\nknapsack to capacity, and the empty space lowers the effective value per pound of\\nhis load. In the 0-1 problem, when we consider whether to include an item in the\\nknapsack, we must compare the solution to the subproblem that includes the item\\nwith the solution to the subproblem that excludes the item before we can make the'),\n",

Note that these are not binary search\\ntrees, since the leaves need not appear in sorted order and internal nodes do not\\ncontain character keys.\\nAn optimal code for a ﬁle is always represented by afull binary tree, in which\\nevery nonleaf node has two children (see Exercise 16.3-2). The ﬁxed-length code\\nin our example is not optimal since its tree, shown in Figure 16.4(a), is not a full bi-\\nnary tree: it contains codewords beginning 10. . . , but none beginning 11. . . . Since\\nwe can now restrict our attention to full binary trees, we can say that ifC is the\\nalphabet from which the characters are drawn and all character frequencies are pos-\\nitive, then the tree for an optimal preﬁx code has exactlyjC jleaves, one for each\\nletter of the alphabet, and exactlyjC j/NUL 1 internal nodes (see Exercise B.5-3).\\nGiven a treeT corresponding to a preﬁx code, we can easily compute the number\\nof bits required to encode a ﬁle. For each characterc in the alphabetC , let the\\nattribute c: freq denote the frequency ofc in the ﬁle and letdT .c/ denote the depth'),\n",

It begins with a set ofjC jleaves and performs a sequence ofjC j/NUL 1\\n“merging” operations to create the ﬁnal tree. The algorithm uses a min-priority\\nqueue Q, keyed on thefreq attribute, to identify the two least-frequent objects to\\nmerge together.

We call such a sub-\\nset that is independent and has maximum possible weight anoptimalsubset of the\\nmatroid. Because the weightw.x/ of any elementx 2S is positive, an optimal\\nsubset is always a maximal independent subset—it always helps to makeA as large\\nas possible.\\nFor example, in theminimum-spanning-treeproblem, we are given a connected\\nundirected graphG D.V; E / and a length functionw such thatw.e/ is the (posi-\\ntive) length of edgee. (We use the term “length” here to refer to the original edge\\nweights for the graph, reserving the term “weight” to refer to the weights in the\\nassociated matroid.) We wish to ﬁnd a subset of the edges that connects all of\\nthe vertices together and has minimum total length. To view this as a problem of\\nﬁnding an optimal subset of a matroid, consider the weighted matroidMG with\\nweight functionw0, wherew0.e/ Dw0 /NUL w.e/ and w0 is larger than the maximum\\nlength of any edge. In this weighted matroid, all weights are positive and an opti-\\nmal subset is a spanning tree of minimum total length in the original graph. More\\nspeciﬁcally, each maximal independent subsetA corresponds to a spanning tree'),\n",

With amortized analy-\\nsis, we can show that the average cost of an operation is small, if we average over a\\nsequence of operations, even though a single operation within the sequence might\\nbe expensive. Amortized analysis differs from average-case analysis in that prob-\\nability is not involved; an amortized analysis guarantees theaverage performance\\nof each operation in the worst case.\\nThe ﬁrst three sections of this chapter cover the three most common techniques\\nused in amortized analysis. Section 17.1 starts with aggregate analysis, in which\\nwe determine an upper boundT .n/ on the total cost of a sequence ofn operations.\\nThe average cost per operation is thenT .n/=n . We take the average cost as the\\namortized cost of each operation, so that all operations have the same amortized\\ncost.\\nSection 17.2 covers the accounting method, in which we determine an amortized\\ncost of each operation. When there is more than one type of operation, each type of\\noperation may have a different amortized cost. The accounting method overcharges\\nsome operations early in the sequence, storing the overcharge as “prepaid credit”\\non speciﬁc objects in the data structure. Later in the sequence, the credit pays for\\noperations that are charged less than they actually cost.\\nSection 17.3 discusses the potential method, which is like the accounting method\\nin that we determine the amortized cost of each operation and may overcharge op-\\nerations early on to compensate for undercharges later. The potential method main-\\ntains the credit as the “potential energy” of the data structure as a whole instead of\\nassociating the credit with individual objects within the data structure.\\nWe shall use two examples to examine these three methods. One is a stack\\nwith the additional operation MULTIPOP , which pops several objects at once. The\\nother is a binary counter that counts up from0 by means of the single operation\\nINCREMENT .'),\n",

Note that this amortized cost applies to\\neach operation, even when there are several types of operations in the sequence.\\nThe other two methods we shall study in this chapter, the accounting method and\\nthe potential method, may assign different amortized costs to different types of\\noperations.\\nStackoperations\\nIn our ﬁrst example of aggregate analysis, we analyze stacks that have been aug-\\nmented with a new operation. Section 10.1 presented the two fundamental stack\\noperations, each of which takesO.1/ time:\\nPUSH .S; x/ pushes objectx onto stackS .\\nPOP.S / pops the top of stackS and returns the popped object. Calling POP on an\\nempty stack generates an error.\\nSince each of these operations runs inO.1/ time, let us consider the cost of each\\nto be1. The total cost of a sequence ofn PUSH and POP operations is thereforen,\\nand the actual running time forn operations is therefore‚.n/.\\nNow we add the stack operation MULTIPOP .S; k/ , which removes thek top ob-\\njects of stackS , popping the entire stack if the stack contains fewer thank objects.\\nOf course, we assume thatk is positive; otherwise the MULTIPOP operation leaves\\nthe stack unchanged.

In fact, although a single MULTIPOP operation\\ncan be expensive, any sequence ofn PUSH , POP, and MULTIPOP operations on an\\ninitially empty stack can cost at mostO.n/. Why? We can pop each object from the\\nstack at most once for each time we have pushed it onto the stack. Therefore, the\\nnumber of times that POP can be called on a nonempty stack, including calls within\\nMULTIPOP , is at most the number of PUSH operations, which is at mostn.

The cost of each INCREMENT operation is linear\\nin the number of bits ﬂipped.\\nAs with the stack example, a cursory analysis yields a bound that is correct but\\nnot tight.

When we execute a POP operation, we charge the operation nothing\\nand pay its actual cost using the credit stored in the stack. To pop a plate, we take\\nthe dollar of credit off the plate and use it to pay the actual cost of the operation.\\nThus, by charging the PUSH operation a little bit more, we can charge the POP\\noperation nothing.'),\n",

In other words, since each plate on the\\nstack has1 dollar of credit on it, and the stack always has a nonnegative number of\\nplates, we have ensured that the amount of credit is always nonnegative. Thus, for\\nany sequence ofn PUSH , POP, and MULTIPOP operations, the total amortized cost\\nis an upper bound on the total actual cost. Since the total amortized cost isO.n/,\\nso is the total actual cost.\\nIncrementingabinarycounter\\nAs another illustration of the accounting method, we analyze the INCREMENT op-\\neration on a binary counter that starts at zero. As we observed earlier, the running\\ntime of this operation is proportional to the number of bits ﬂipped, which we shall\\nuse as our cost for this example. Let us once again use a dollar bill to represent\\neach unit of cost (the ﬂipping of a bit in this example).\\nFor the amortized analysis, let us charge an amortized cost of2 dollars to set a\\nbit to1. When a bit is set, we use1 dollar (out of the2 dollars charged) to pay\\nfor the actual setting of the bit, and we place the other dollar on the bit as credit to\\nbe used later when we ﬂip the bit back to0. At any point in time, every1 in the\\ncounter has a dollar of credit on it, and thus we can charge nothing to reset a bit\\nto 0; we just pay for the reset with the dollar bill on the bit.\\nNow we can determine the amortized cost of INCREMENT . The cost of resetting\\nthe bits within thewhileloop is paid for by the dollars on the bits that are reset. The\\nINCREMENT procedure sets at most one bit, in line 6, and therefore the amortized\\ncost of an INCREMENT operation is at most2 dollars. The number of1s in the\\ncounter never becomes negative, and thus the amount of credit stays nonnegative\\nat all times. Thus, forn INCREMENT operations, the total amortized cost isO.n/,\\nwhich bounds the total actual cost.\\nExercises\\n17.2-1\\nSuppose we perform a sequence of stack operations on a stack whose size never\\nexceeds k. After everyk operations, we make a copy of the entire stack for backup\\npurposes. Show that the cost ofn stack operations, including copying the stack,\\nis O.n/ by assigning suitable amortized costs to the various stack operations.'),\n",

The details of the data-structuring method\\nused to organize the table are unimportant; we might use a stack (Section 10.1),\\na heap (Chapter 6), or a hash table (Chapter 11).

A table ﬁlls\\nup when all slots have been used or, equivalently, when its load factor is1.1 In some\\nsoftware environments, upon attempting to insert an item into a full table, the only\\nalternative is to abort with an error. We shall assume, however, that our software\\nenvironment, like many modern ones, provides a memory-management system that\\ncan allocate and free blocks of storage on request. Thus, upon inserting an item\\ninto a full table, we canexpandthe table by allocating a new table with more slots\\nthan the old table had. Because we always need the table to reside in contiguous\\nmemory, we must allocate a new array for the larger table and then copy items from\\nthe old table into the new table.\\nA common heuristic allocates a new table with twice as many slots as the old\\none. If the only table operations are insertions, then the load factor of the table is\\nalways at least1=2, and thus the amount of wasted space never exceeds half the\\ntotal space in the table.\\nIn the following pseudocode, we assume thatT is an object representing the\\ntable. The attributeT: table contains a pointer to the block of storage representing\\nthe table,T: num contains the number of items in the table, andT: size gives the total\\nnumber of slots in the table.

In order to limit the amount of wasted space, however,\\nwe might wish tocontractthe table when the load factor becomes too small. Table\\ncontraction is analogous to table expansion: when the number of items in the table\\ndrops too low, we allocate a new, smaller table and then copy the items from the\\nold table into the new one. We can then free the storage for the old table by return-\\ning it to the memory-management system.

This strategy would guarantee that the load factor of\\nthe table never drops below1=2, but unfortunately, it can cause the amortized cost\\nof an operation to be quite large. Consider the following scenario. We performn\\noperations on a tableT , wheren is an exact power of2. The ﬁrstn=2 operations are\\ninsertions, which by our previous analysis cost a total of‚.n/. At the end of this\\nsequence of insertions,T: num DT: size Dn=2. For the secondn=2 operations,\\nwe perform the following sequence:\\ninsert, delete, delete, insert, insert, delete, delete, insert, insert, . . . .\\nThe ﬁrst insertion causes the table to expand to sizen. The two following deletions\\ncause the table to contract back to sizen=2. Two further insertions cause another\\nexpansion, and so forth. The cost of each expansion and contraction is‚.n/, and\\nthere are‚.n/ of them. Thus, the total cost of then operations is‚.n2/, making\\nthe amortized cost of an operation‚.n/.\\nThe downside of this strategy is obvious: after expanding the table, we do not\\ndelete enough items to pay for a contraction. Likewise, after contracting the table,\\nwe do not insert enough items to pay for an expansion.\\nWe can improve upon this strategy by allowing the load factor of the table to\\ndrop below1=2. Speciﬁcally, we continue to double the table size upon inserting\\nan item into a full table, but we halve the table size when deleting an item causes\\nthe table to become less than1=4 full, rather than1=2 full as before. The load\\nfactor of the table is therefore bounded below by the constant1=4.\\nIntuitively, we would consider a load factor of1=2 to be ideal, and the table’s\\npotential would then be0. As the load factor deviates from1=2, the potential\\nincreases so that by the time we expand or contract the table, the table has garnered\\nsufﬁcient potential to pay for copying all the items into the newly allocated table.\\nThus, we will need a potential function that has grown toT: num by the time that\\nthe load factor has either increased to1 or decreased to1=4. After either expanding\\nor contracting the table, the load factor goes back to1=2 and the table’s potential\\nreduces back to0.\\nWe omit the code for TABLE -DELETE , since it is analogous to TABLE -INSERT .\\nFor our analysis, we shall assume that whenever the number of items in the table\\ndrops to0, we free the storage for the table. That is, ifT: num D0, thenT: size D0.\\nWe can now use the potential method to analyze the cost of a sequence ofn\\nTABLE -INSERT and TABLE -DELETE operations.

Multiple platters increase only the disk drive’s capacity\\nand not its performance.\\nAlthough disks are cheaper and have higher capacity than main memory, they are\\nmuch, much slower because they have moving mechanical parts.1 The mechanical\\nmotion has two components: platter rotation and arm movement. As of this writing,\\ncommodity disks rotate at speeds of 5400–15,000 revolutions per minute (RPM).\\nWe typically see 15,000 RPM speeds in server-grade drives, 7200 RPM speeds\\nin drives for desktops, and 5400 RPM speeds in drives for laptops. Although\\n7200 RPM may seem fast, one rotation takes 8.33 milliseconds, which is over 5\\norders of magnitude longer than the 50 nanosecond access times (more or less)\\ncommonly found for silicon memory. In other words, if we have to wait a full rota-\\ntion for a particular item to come under the read/write head, we could access main\\nmemory more than 100,000 times during that span. On average we have to wait\\nfor only half a rotation, but still, the difference in access times for silicon memory\\ncompared with disks is enormous. Moving the arms also takes some time. As of\\nthis writing, average access times for commodity disks are in the range of 8 to 11\\nmilliseconds.\\nIn order to amortize the time spent waiting for mechanical movements, disks\\naccess not just one item but several at a time. Information is divided into a number\\nof equal-sizedpagesof bits that appear consecutively within tracks, and each disk\\nread or write is of one or more entire pages. For a typical disk, a page might be211\\nto 214 bytes in length. Once the read/write head is positioned correctly and the disk\\nhas rotated to the beginning of the desired page, reading or writing a magnetic disk\\nis entirely electronic (aside from the rotation of the disk), and the disk can quickly\\nread or write large amounts of data.\\nOften, accessing a page of information and reading it from a disk takes longer\\nthan examining all the information read. For this reason, in this chapter we shall\\nlook separately at the two principal components of the running time:\\n\\x0f the number of disk accesses, and\\n\\x0f the CPU (computing) time.\\nWe measure the number of disk accesses in terms of the number of pages of infor-\\nmation that need to be read from or written to the disk.

(We as-\\nsume that ifx is already in main memory, then DISK -READ .x/ requires no disk\\naccesses; it is a “no-op.”) Similarly, the operation DISK -WRITE .x/ is used to save\\nany changes that have been made to the attributes of objectx. That is, the typical\\npattern for working with an object is as follows:\\nx Da pointer to some object\\nDISK -READ .x/\\noperations that access and/or modify the attributes ofx\\nDISK -WRITE .x/ / /omitted if no attributes ofx were changed\\nother operations that access but do not modify attributes ofx\\nThe system can keep only a limited number of pages in main memory at any one\\ntime. We shall assume that the system ﬂushes from main memory pages no longer\\nin use; our B-tree algorithms will ignore this issue.\\nSince in most systems the running time of a B-tree algorithm depends primar-\\nily on the number of DISK -READ and DISK -WRITE operations it performs, we\\ntypically want each of these operations to read or write as much information as\\npossible. Thus, a B-tree node is usually as large as a whole disk page, and this size\\nlimits the number of children a B-tree node can have.\\nFor a large B-tree stored on a disk, we often see branching factors between50\\nand 2000, depending on the size of a key relative to the size of a page. A large\\nbranching factor dramatically reduces both the height of the tree and the number of\\ndisk accesses required to ﬁnd any key. Figure 18.3 shows a B-tree with a branching\\nfactor of1001 and height2 that can store over one billion keys; nevertheless, since\\nwe can keep the root node permanently in main memory, we can ﬁnd any key in\\nthis tree by making at most only two disk accesses.'),\n",

In practice, one might actually store with each key just a pointer to\\nanother disk page containing the satellite information for that key. The pseudocode\\nin this chapter implicitly assumes that the satellite information associated with a\\nkey, or the pointer to such satellite information, travels with the key whenever the\\nkey is moved from node to node. A common variant on a B-tree, known as a\\nBC-tree, stores all the satellite information in the leaves and stores only keys and\\nchild pointers in the internal nodes, thus maximizing the branching factor of the\\ninternal nodes.\\nA B-treeT is a rooted tree (whose root isT: root) having the following proper-\\nties:\\n1.

As with binary search trees, we search for the leaf position\\nat which to insert the new key. With a B-tree, however, we cannot simply create\\na new leaf node and insert it, as the resulting tree would fail to be a valid B-tree.\\nInstead, we insert the new key into an existing leaf node. Since we cannot insert a\\nkey into a leaf node that is full, we introduce an operation thatsplitsa full nodey\\n(having 2t /NUL1 keys) around itsmediankey y: keyt into two nodes having onlyt /NUL1\\nkeys each. The median key moves up intoy’s parent to identify the dividing point\\nbetween the two new trees. But ify’s parent is also full, we must split it before we\\ncan insert the new key, and thus we could end up splitting full nodes all the way up\\nthe tree.\\nAs with a binary search tree, we can insert a key into a B-tree in a single pass\\ndown the tree from the root to a leaf. To do so, we do not wait to ﬁnd out whether\\nwe will actually need to split a full node in order to do the insertion. Instead, as we\\ntravel down the tree searching for the position where the new key belongs, we split\\neach full node we come to along the way (including the leaf itself).

To split a full root, we will ﬁrst make the\\nroot a child of a new empty root node, so that we can use B-TREE -SPLIT -CHILD .\\nThe tree thus grows in height by one; splitting is the only means by which the tree\\ngrows.\\nFigure 18.5 illustrates this process.

As in\\ninsertion, we must guard against deletion producing a tree whose structure violates\\nthe B-tree properties. Just as we had to ensure that a node didn’t get too big due to\\ninsertion, we must ensure that a node doesn’t get too small during deletion (except\\nthat the root is allowed to have fewer than the minimum numbert /NUL 1 of keys).\\nJust as a simple insertion algorithm might have to back up if a node on the path\\nto where the key was to be inserted was full, a simple approach to deletion might\\nhave to back up if a node (other than the root) along the path to where the key is to\\nbe deleted has the minimum number of keys.\\nThe procedure B-TREE -DELETE deletes the keyk from the subtree rooted atx.\\nWe design this procedure to guarantee that whenever it calls itself recursively on a\\nnode x, the number of keys inx is at least the minimum degreet . Note that this\\ncondition requires one more key than the minimum required by the usual B-tree\\nconditions, so that sometimes a key may have to be moved into a child node before\\nrecursion descends to that child. This strengthened condition allows us to delete a\\nkey from the tree in one downward pass without having to “back up” (with one ex-\\nception, which we’ll explain). You should interpret the following speciﬁcation for\\ndeletion from a B-tree with the understanding that if the root nodex ever becomes\\nan internal node having no keys (this situation can occur in cases 2c and 3b on\\npages 501–502), then we deletex, andx’s only childx: c 1 becomes the new root\\nof the tree, decreasing the height of the tree by one and preserving the property that\\nthe root of the tree contains at least one key (unless the tree is empty).'),\n",

As in our discussion of\\npriority queues in Section 6.5, when we use a mergeable heap in an application, we\\noften store a handle to the corresponding application object in each mergeable-heap\\nelement, as well as a handle to the corresponding mergeable-heap element in each\\napplication object. The exact nature of these handles depends on the application\\nand its implementation.\\nLike several other data structures that we have seen, Fibonacci heaps are based\\non rooted trees. We represent each element by a node within a tree, and each\\nnode has akey attribute. For the remainder of this chapter, we shall use the term\\n“node” instead of “element.” We shall also ignore issues of allocating nodes prior\\nto insertion and freeing nodes following deletion, assuming instead that the code\\ncalling the heap procedures deals with these details.\\nSection 19.1 deﬁnes Fibonacci heaps, discusses how we represent them, and\\npresents the potential function used for their amortized analysis. Section 19.2\\nshows how to implement the mergeable-heap operations and achieve the amortized\\ntime bounds shown in Figure 19.1. The remaining two operations, DECREASE -\\nKEY and DELETE , form the focus of Section 19.3. Finally, Section 19.4 ﬁnishes a\\nkey part of the analysis and also explains the curious name of the data structure.\\n19.1 StructureofFibonacciheaps\\nA Fibonacci heapis a collection of rooted trees that aremin-heap ordered. That\\nis, each tree obeys themin-heapproperty: the key of a node is greater than or equal\\nto the key of its parent. Figure 19.2(a) shows an example of a Fibonacci heap.\\nAs Figure 19.2(b) shows, each nodex contains a pointerx: p to its parent and\\na pointerx: child to any one of its children. The children ofx are linked together\\nin a circular, doubly linked list, which we call thechild listof x. Each childy in\\na child list has pointersy: left and y: right that point toy’s left and right siblings,\\nrespectively. If nodey is an only child, theny: left Dy: right Dy. Siblings may\\nappear in a child list in any order.'),\n",

Instead, we can determine its elements\\nfrom itsmin and max attributes.

These attributes will help us in\\nfour ways:\\n1. The MINIMUM and MAXIMUM operations do not even need to recurse, for they\\ncan just return the values ofmin or max.\\n2. The SUCCESSOR operation can avoid making a recursive call to determine\\nwhether the successor of a valuex lies within high.x/. That is becausex’s\\nsuccessor lies within its cluster if and only ifx is strictly less than themax\\nattribute of its cluster. A symmetric argument holds for PREDECESSOR and\\nmin.\\n3. We can tell whether a vEB tree has no elements, exactly one element, or at least\\ntwo elements in constant time from itsmin and max values. This ability will\\nhelp in the INSERT and DELETE operations. Ifmin and max are bothNIL , then\\nthe vEB tree has no elements. Ifmin and max are non-NIL but are equal to each\\nother, then the vEB tree has exactly one element. Otherwise, bothmin and max\\nare non-NIL but are unequal, and the vEB tree has two or more elements.\\n4. If we know that a vEB tree is empty, we can insert an element into it by updating\\nonly itsmin and max attributes. Hence, we can insert into an empty vEB tree in\\nconstant time. Similarly, if we know that a vEB tree has only one element, we\\ncan delete that element in constant time by updating onlymin and max. These\\nproperties will allow us to cut short the chain of recursive calls.\\nEven if the universe sizeu is an odd power of2, the difference in the sizes\\nof the summary vEB tree and the clusters will not turn out to affect the asymptotic\\nrunning times of the vEB-tree operations.

If the vEB treeV con-\\ntains only one element, then it’s just as easy to delete it as it was to insert an element\\ninto an empty vEB tree: just setmin and max to NIL .

In this\\ncase, we will have to delete an element from a cluster. The element we delete from\\na cluster might not bex, however, because ifx equals min, then once we have\\ndeleted x, some other element within one ofV ’s clusters becomes the newmin,\\nand we have to delete that other element from its cluster. If the test in line 9 reveals\\nthat we are in this case, then line 10 setsﬁrst-cluster to the number of the cluster\\nthat contains the lowest element other thanmin, and line 11 setsx to the value of\\nthe lowest element in that cluster. This element becomes the newmin in line 12\\nand, because we setx to its value, it is the element that will be deleted from its\\ncluster.\\nWhen we reach line 13, we know that we need to delete elementx from its\\ncluster, whether x was the value originally passed toVEB-T REE -DELETE or x\\nis the element becoming the new minimum. Line 13 deletesx from its cluster.\\nThat cluster might now become empty, which line 14 tests, and if it does, then\\nwe need to removex’s cluster number from the summary, which line 15 handles.\\nAfter updating the summary, we might need to updatemax. Line 16 checks to see\\nwhether we are deleting the maximum element inV and, if we are, then line 17 sets\\nsummary-max to the number of the highest-numbered nonempty cluster. (The call\\nVEB-T REE -MAXIMUM .V: summary/ works because we have already recursively\\ncalled VEB-T REE -DELETE on V: summary, and thereforeV: summary: max has al-\\nready been updated as necessary.) If all ofV ’s clusters are empty, then the only\\nremaining element inV is min; line 18 checks for this case, and line 19 updates\\nmax appropriately. Otherwise, line 20 setsmax to the maximum element in the\\nhighest-numbered nonempty cluster.

Although we do not have to update the summary in this\\ncase, we might have to updatemax. Line 21 tests for this case, and if we have to\\nupdate max, line 22 does so (again relying on the recursive call to have corrected\\nmax in the cluster).\\nNow we show thatVEB-T REE -DELETE runs in O.lg lgu/ time in the worst\\ncase.

In Section 21.2, we look at a simple linked-list\\nimplementation for disjoint sets. Section 21.3 presents a more efﬁcient represen-\\ntation using rooted trees.

Other applications may require a prespeciﬁed rule for choosing the repre-\\nsentative, such as choosing the smallest member in the set (assuming, of course,\\nthat the elements can be ordered).\\nAs in the other dynamic-set implementations we have studied, we represent each\\nelement of a set by an object.

We assume that the two sets are dis-\\njoint prior to the operation. The representative of the resulting set is any member\\nof Sx [Sy , although many implementations of UNION speciﬁcally choose the\\nrepresentative of eitherSx or Sy as the new representative.

Since\\nthe sets are disjoint, each UNION operation reduces the number of sets by one.\\nAfter n /NUL 1 UNION operations, therefore, only one set remains. The number of\\nUNION operations is thus at mostn /NUL 1. Note also that since the MAKE -SET\\noperations are included in the total number of operationsm, we havem \\x15n.

Fig-\\nure 21.1(a), for example, shows a graph with four connected components.\\nThe procedure CONNECTED -COMPONENTS that follows uses the disjoint-set\\noperations to compute the connected components of a graph. Once CONNECTED -\\nCOMPONENTS has preprocessed the graph, the procedure SAME -COMPONENT\\nanswers queries about whether two vertices are in the same connected component.1\\n(In pseudocode, we denote the set of vertices of a graphG by G: V and the set of\\nedges byG: E.)\\n1When the edges of the graph are static—not changing over time—we can compute the connected\\ncomponents faster by using depth-ﬁrst search (Exercise 22.3-12). Sometimes, however, the edges\\nare added dynamically and we need to maintain the connected components as each edge is added. In\\nthis case, the implementation given here can be more efﬁcient than running a new depth-ﬁrst search\\nfor each new edge.'),\n",

We know that each timex’s pointer was updated,x must have\\nstarted in the smaller set. The ﬁrst timex’s pointer was updated, therefore, the\\nresulting set must have had at least2 members.

Since the largest set has at mostn\\nmembers, each object’s pointer is updated at mostdlg netimes over all the UNION\\noperations.

The obvious approach would be to make\\nthe root of the tree with fewer nodes point to the root of the tree with more nodes.\\nRather than explicitly keeping track of the size of the subtree rooted at each node,\\nwe shall use an approach that eases the analysis. For each node, we maintain a\\nrank, which is an upper bound on the height of the node. In union by rank, we\\nmake the root with smaller rank point to the root with larger rank during a UNION\\noperation.\\nThe second heuristic,path compression, is also quite simple and highly effec-\\ntive.

Prim’s minimum-spanning-\\ntree algorithm (Section 23.2) and Dijkstra’s single-source shortest-paths algorithm\\n(Section 24.3) use ideas similar to those in breadth-ﬁrst search.\\nGiven a graphG D.V; E / and a distinguishedsource vertex s, breadth-ﬁrst\\nsearch systematically explores the edges ofG to “discover” every vertex that is\\nreachable from s. It computes the distance (smallest number of edges) froms\\nto each reachable vertex. It also produces a “breadth-ﬁrst tree” with roots that\\ncontains all reachable vertices. For any vertex\\x17 reachable froms, the simple path\\nin the breadth-ﬁrst tree froms to \\x17 corresponds to a “shortest path” froms to \\x17\\nin G, that is, a path containing the smallest number of edges. The algorithm works\\non both directed and undirected graphs.\\nBreadth-ﬁrst search is so named because it expands the frontier between discov-\\nered and undiscovered vertices uniformly across the breadth of the frontier. That\\nis, the algorithm discovers all vertices at distancek from s before discovering any\\nvertices at distancek C1.\\nTo keep track of progress, breadth-ﬁrst search colors each vertex white, gray, or\\nblack. All vertices start out white and may later become gray and then black. A\\nvertex isdiscoveredthe ﬁrst time it is encountered during the search, at which time\\nit becomes nonwhite. Gray and black vertices, therefore, have been discovered, but\\nbreadth-ﬁrst search distinguishes between them to ensure that the search proceeds\\nin a breadth-ﬁrst manner.1 If .u; \\x17/ 2 E and vertex u is black, then vertex\\x17\\nis either gray or black; that is, all vertices adjacent to black vertices have been\\ndiscovered. Gray vertices may have some adjacent white vertices; they represent\\nthe frontier between discovered and undiscovered vertices.\\nBreadth-ﬁrst search constructs a breadth-ﬁrst tree, initially containing only its\\nroot, which is the source vertexs. Whenever the search discovers a white vertex\\x17\\nin the course of scanning the adjacency list of an already discovered vertexu, the\\nvertex \\x17 and the edge.u; \\x17/ are added to the tree. We say thatu is thepredecessor\\nor parentof \\x17 in the breadth-ﬁrst tree. Since a vertex is discovered at most once, it\\nhas at most one parent. Ancestor and descendant relationships in the breadth-ﬁrst\\ntree are deﬁned relative to the roots as usual: ifu is on the simple path in the tree\\nfrom the roots to vertex\\x17, thenu is an ancestor of\\x17 and \\x17 is a descendant ofu.\\n1We distinguish between gray and black vertices to help us understand how breadth-ﬁrst search op-\\nerates. In fact, as Exercise 22.2-3 shows, we would get the same result even if we did not distinguish\\nbetween gray and black vertices.'),\n",

(See Exercise 22.2-5.)\\nAnalysis\\nBefore proving the various properties of breadth-ﬁrst search, we take on the some-\\nwhat easier job of analyzing its running time on an input graphG D.V; E / . We\\nuse aggregate analysis, as we saw in Section 17.1. After initialization, breadth-ﬁrst\\nsearch never whitens a vertex, and thus the test in line 13 ensures that each vertex\\nis enqueued at most once, and hence dequeued at most once. The operations of\\nenqueuing and dequeuing takeO.1/ time, and so the total time devoted to queue\\noperations isO.V / . Because the procedure scans the adjacency list of each vertex\\nonly when the vertex is dequeued, it scans each adjacency list at most once. Since\\nthe sum of the lengths of all the adjacency lists is‚.E /, the total time spent in\\nscanning adjacency lists isO.E /. The overhead for initialization isO.V / , and\\nthus the total running time of the BFS procedure isO.V CE /. Thus, breadth-ﬁrst\\nsearch runs in time linear in the size of the adjacency-list representation ofG.\\nShortestpaths\\nAt the beginning of this section, we claimed that breadth-ﬁrst search ﬁnds the dis-\\ntance to each reachable vertex in a graphG D.V; E / from a given source vertex\\ns 2V . Deﬁne theshortest-pathdistance ı.s; \\x17/ from s to \\x17 as the minimum num-\\nber of edges in any path from vertexs to vertex\\x17; if there is no path froms to \\x17,\\nthen ı.s; \\x17/ D1. We call a path of lengthı.s; \\x17/ from s to \\x17 a shortest path2\\nfrom s to \\x17. Before showing that breadth-ﬁrst search correctly computes shortest-\\npath distances, we investigate an important property of shortest-path distances.\\n2In Chapters 24 and 25, we shall generalize our study of shortest paths to weighted graphs, in which\\nevery edge has a real-valued weight and the weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its con-\\nstituent edges. The graphs considered in the present chapter are unweighted or, equivalently, all\\nedges have unit weight.'),\n",

Depth-ﬁrst search explores edges out\\nof the most recently discovered vertex\\x17 that still has unexplored edges leaving it.\\nOnce all of\\x17’s edges have been explored, the search “backtracks” to explore edges\\nleaving the vertex from which\\x17 was discovered. This process continues until we\\nhave discovered all the vertices that are reachable from the original source vertex.\\nIf any undiscovered vertices remain, then depth-ﬁrst search selects one of them as\\na new source, and it repeats the search from that source. The algorithm repeats this\\nentire process until it has discovered every vertex.3\\nAs in breadth-ﬁrst search, whenever depth-ﬁrst search discovers a vertex\\x17 dur-\\ning a scan of the adjacency list of an already discovered vertexu, it records this\\nevent by setting\\x17’s predecessor attribute\\x17: \\x19 to u. Unlike breadth-ﬁrst search,\\nwhose predecessor subgraph forms a tree, the predecessor subgraph produced by\\na depth-ﬁrst search may be composed of several trees, because the search may\\nrepeat from multiple sources.

Each vertex is initially white, is grayed when it isdiscovered\\nin the search, and is blackened when it isﬁnished, that is, when its adjacency list\\nhas been examined completely. This technique guarantees that each vertex ends up\\nin exactly one depth-ﬁrst tree, so that these trees are disjoint.\\nBesides creating a depth-ﬁrst forest, depth-ﬁrst search alsotimestampseach ver-\\ntex.

Although conceptually, breadth-ﬁrst search could proceed\\nfrom multiple sources and depth-ﬁrst search could be limited to one source, our approach reﬂects how\\nthe results of these searches are typically used. Breadth-ﬁrst search usually serves to ﬁnd shortest-\\npath distances (and the associated predecessor subgraph) from a given source.

If we represent the discovery of vertexu with\\na left parenthesis “.u” and represent its ﬁnishing by a right parenthesis “u/”, then\\nthe history of discoveries and ﬁnishings makes a well-formed expression in the\\nsense that the parentheses are properly nested.

Moreover, since \\x17 was discovered more recently thanu, all of its outgo-\\ning edges are explored, and\\x17 is ﬁnished, before the search returns to and ﬁn-\\nishes u.

The type of each edge can\\nprovide important information about a graph. For example, in the next section, we\\nshall see that a directed graph is acyclic if and only if a depth-ﬁrst search yields no\\n“back” edges (Lemma 22.11).\\nWe can deﬁne four edge types in terms of the depth-ﬁrst forestG\\x19 produced by\\na depth-ﬁrst search onG:\\n1. Treeedges are edges in the depth-ﬁrst forestG\\x19 . Edge.u; \\x17/ is a tree edge if\\x17\\nwas ﬁrst discovered by exploring edge.u; \\x17/ .\\n2. Back edgesare those edges.u; \\x17/ connecting a vertexu to an ancestor\\x17 in a\\ndepth-ﬁrst tree. We consider self-loops, which may occur in directed graphs, to\\nbe back edges.\\n3. Forward edgesare those nontree edges.u; \\x17/ connecting a vertexu to a de-\\nscendant \\x17 in a depth-ﬁrst tree.\\n4. Cross edgesare all other edges. They can go between vertices in the same\\ndepth-ﬁrst tree, as long as one vertex is not an ancestor of the other, or they can\\ngo between vertices in different depth-ﬁrst trees.\\nIn Figures 22.4 and 22.5, edge labels indicate edge types. Figure 22.5(c) also shows\\nhow to redraw the graph of Figure 22.5(a) so that all tree and forward edges head\\ndownward in a depth-ﬁrst tree and all back edges go up. We can redraw any graph\\nin this fashion.\\nThe DFS algorithm has enough information to classify some edges as it encoun-\\nters them. The key idea is that when we ﬁrst explore an edge.u; \\x17/ , the color of\\nvertex \\x17 tells us something about the edge:\\n1. WHITE indicates a tree edge,\\n2. GRAY indicates a back edge, and\\n3. BLACK indicates a forward or cross edge.\\nThe ﬁrst case is immediate from the speciﬁcation of the algorithm. For the sec-\\nond case, observe that the gray vertices always form a linear chain of descendants\\ncorresponding to the stack of active DFS-VISIT invocations; the number of gray\\nvertices is one more than the depth in the depth-ﬁrst forest of the vertex most re-\\ncently discovered. Exploration always proceeds from the deepest gray vertex, so'),\n",

Because the strongly con-\\nnected components of G and GT are the same, Lemma 22.14 implies that\\nf .C / < f .C 0/.\\nCorollary 22.15 provides the key to understanding why the strongly connected\\ncomponents algorithm works. Let us examine what happens when we perform the\\nsecond depth-ﬁrst search, which is onGT. We start with the strongly connected\\ncomponent C whose ﬁnishing timef .C / is maximum. The search starts from\\nsome vertexx 2C , and it visits all vertices inC . By Corollary 22.15,GT contains\\nno edges fromC to any other strongly connected component, and so the search\\nfrom x will not visit vertices in any other component. Thus, the tree rooted atx\\ncontains exactly the vertices ofC . Having completed visiting all vertices inC ,\\nthe search in line 3 selects as a root a vertex from some other strongly connected\\ncomponent C 0 whose ﬁnishing timef .C 0/ is maximum over all components other\\nthan C . Again, the search will visit all vertices inC 0, but by Corollary 22.15,\\nthe only edges inGT from C 0 to any other component must be toC , which we\\nhave already visited. In general, when the depth-ﬁrst search ofGT in line 3 visits\\nany strongly connected component, any edges out of that component must be to\\ncomponents that the search already visited. Each depth-ﬁrst tree, therefore, will be\\nexactly one strongly connected component. The following theorem formalizes this\\nargument.\\nTheorem22.16\\nThe STRONGLY -CONNECTED -COMPONENTS procedure correctly computes the\\nstrongly connected components of the directed graphG provided as its input.\\nProof We argue by induction on the number of depth-ﬁrst trees found in the\\ndepth-ﬁrst search ofGT in line 3 that the vertices of each tree form a strongly\\nconnected component. The inductive hypothesis is that the ﬁrstk trees produced\\nin line 3 are strongly connected components. The basis for the induction, when\\nk D0, is trivial.\\nIn the inductive step, we assume that each of the ﬁrstk depth-ﬁrst trees produced\\nin line 3 is a strongly connected component, and we consider the.k C1/st tree\\nproduced. Let the root of this tree be vertexu, and letu be in strongly connected\\ncomponent C . Because of how we choose roots in the depth-ﬁrst search in line 3,\\nu: f Df .C / > f .C 0/ for any strongly connected componentC 0 other than C\\nthat has yet to be visited. By the inductive hypothesis, at the time that the search\\nvisits u, all other vertices ofC are white. By the white-path theorem, therefore, all\\nother vertices ofC are descendants ofu in its depth-ﬁrst tree. Moreover, by the\\ninductive hypothesis and by Corollary 22.15, any edges inGT that leaveC must be\\nto strongly connected components that have already been visited. Thus, no vertex'),\n",

Prim’s algorithm operates much\\nlike Dijkstra’s algorithm for ﬁnding shortest paths in a graph, which we shall see in\\nSection 24.3. Prim’s algorithm has the property that the edges in the setA always\\nform a single tree. As Figure 23.5 shows, the tree starts from an arbitrary root\\nvertex r and grows until the tree spans all the vertices inV . Each step adds to the\\ntree A a light edge that connectsA to an isolated vertex—one on which no edge\\nof A is incident. By Corollary 23.2, this rule adds only edges that are safe forA;\\ntherefore, when the algorithm terminates, the edges inA form a minimum spanning\\ntree. This strategy qualiﬁes as greedy since at each step it adds to the tree an edge\\nthat contributes the minimum amount possible to the tree’s weight.\\nIn order to implement Prim’s algorithm efﬁciently, we need a fast way to select\\na new edge to add to the tree formed by the edges inA.

The shortest-path weight from sources\\nappears within each vertex. Because verticese and f form a negative-weight cycle reachable froms,\\nthey have shortest-path weights of/NUL1. Because vertexg is reachable from a vertex whose shortest-\\npath weight is/NUL1, it, too, has a shortest-path weight of/NUL1. Vertices such ash, i , andj are not\\nreachable froms, and so their shortest-path weights are1, even though they lie on a negative-weight\\ncycle.\\nSome shortest-paths algorithms, such as Dijkstra’s algorithm, assume that all\\nedge weights in the input graph are nonnegative, as in the road-map example. Oth-\\ners, such as the Bellman-Ford algorithm, allow negative-weight edges in the in-\\nput graph and produce a correct answer as long as no negative-weight cycles are\\nreachable from the source. Typically, if there is such a negative-weight cycle, the\\nalgorithm can detect and report its existence.\\nCycles\\nCan a shortest path contain a cycle? As we have just seen, it cannot contain a\\nnegative-weight cycle. Nor can it contain a positive-weight cycle, since remov-\\ning the cycle from the path produces a path with the same source and destination\\nvertices and a lower path weight. That is, ifp Dh\\x170; \\x17 1; : : : ; \\x17 k iis a path and\\nc Dh\\x17i ; \\x17 i C1; : : : ; \\x17 j iis a positive-weight cycle on this path (so that\\x17i D\\x17j and\\nw.c/ > 0 ), then the pathp0 Dh\\x170; \\x17 1; : : : ; \\x17 i ; \\x17 j C1; \\x17 j C2; : : : ; \\x17 k ihas weight\\nw.p 0/ Dw.p/ /NUL w.c/ < w.p/ , and sop cannot be a shortest path from\\x170 to \\x17k .\\nThat leaves only0-weight cycles. We can remove a0-weight cycle from any\\npath to produce another path whose weight is the same. Thus, if there is a shortest\\npath from a source vertexs to a destination vertex\\x17 that contains a0-weight cycle,\\nthen there is another shortest path froms to \\x17 without this cycle. As long as a\\nshortest path has0-weight cycles, we can repeatedly remove these cycles from the\\npath until we have a shortest path that is cycle-free. Therefore, without loss of\\ngenerality we can assume that when we are ﬁnding shortest paths, they have no\\ncycles, i.e., they are simple paths. Since any acyclic path in a graphG D.V; E /'),\n",

As discussed in the chapter notes for Chapter 6, in\\nthis case several data structures can implement the various priority-queue opera-\\ntions more efﬁciently than a binary heap or a Fibonacci heap.

This problem might arise in making a table of distances be-\\ntween all pairs of cities for a road atlas. As in Chapter 24, we are given a weighted,\\ndirected graphG D.V; E / with a weight functionw WE !R that maps edges\\nto real-valued weights. We wish to ﬁnd, for every pair of verticesu; \\x17 2V , a\\nshortest (least-weight) path fromu to \\x17, where the weight of a path is the sum of\\nthe weights of its constituent edges. We typically want the output in tabular form:\\nthe entry inu’s row and\\x17’s column should be the weight of a shortest path fromu\\nto \\x17.\\nWe can solve an all-pairs shortest-paths problem by running a single-source\\nshortest-paths algorithm jV jtimes, once for each vertex as the source. If all\\nedge weights are nonnegative, we can use Dijkstra’s algorithm. If we use\\nthe linear-array implementation of the min-priority queue, the running time is\\nO.V 3 CVE / DO.V 3/. The binary min-heap implementation of the min-priority\\nqueue yields a running time ofO.VE lg V / , which is an improvement if the graph\\nis sparse. Alternatively, we can implement the min-priority queue with a Fibonacci\\nheap, yielding a running time ofO.V 2 lg V CVE /.\\nIf the graph has negative-weight edges, we cannot use Dijkstra’s algorithm. In-\\nstead, we must run the slower Bellman-Ford algorithm once from each vertex. The\\nresulting running time isO.V 2E /, which on a dense graph isO.V 4/. In this chap-\\nter we shall see how to do better. We also investigate the relation of the all-pairs\\nshortest-paths problem to matrix multiplication and study its algebraic structure.\\nUnlike the single-source algorithms, which assume an adjacency-list represen-\\ntation of the graph, most of the algorithms in this chapter use an adjacency-\\nmatrix representation.

Imagine a mate-\\nrial coursing through a system from a source, where the material is produced, to\\na sink, where it is consumed. The source produces the material at some steady\\nrate, and the sink consumes the material at the same rate. The “ﬂow” of the mate-\\nrial at any point in the system is intuitively the rate at which the material moves.\\nFlow networks can model many problems, including liquids ﬂowing through pipes,\\nparts through assembly lines, current through electrical networks, and information\\nthrough communication networks.\\nWe can think of each directed edge in a ﬂow network as a conduit for the mate-\\nrial. Each conduit has a stated capacity, given as a maximum rate at which the ma-\\nterial can ﬂow through the conduit, such as200 gallons of liquid per hour through\\na pipe or20 amperes of electrical current through a wire. Vertices are conduit\\njunctions, and other than the source and sink, material ﬂows through the vertices\\nwithout collecting in them. In other words, the rate at which material enters a ver-\\ntex must equal the rate at which it leaves the vertex. We call this property “ﬂow\\nconservation,” and it is equivalent to Kirchhoff’s current law when the material is\\nelectrical current.\\nIn the maximum-ﬂow problem, we wish to compute the greatest rate at which\\nwe can ship material from the source to the sink without violating any capacity\\nconstraints. It is one of the simplest problems concerning ﬂow networks and, as\\nwe shall see in this chapter, this problem can be solved by efﬁcient algorithms.\\nMoreover, we can adapt the basic techniques used in maximum-ﬂow algorithms to\\nsolve other network-ﬂow problems.\\nThis chapter presents two general methods for solving the maximum-ﬂow prob-\\nlem.

Fortunately, this problem is no harder than ordinary maximum\\nﬂow.\\nWe can reduce the problem of determining a maximum ﬂow in a network with\\nmultiple sources and multiple sinks to an ordinary maximum-ﬂow problem. Fig-\\nure 26.3(b) shows how to convert the network from (a) to an ordinary ﬂow network\\nwith only a single source and a single sink. We add asupersource s and add a\\ndirected edge.s; s i / with capacityc.s; s i / D1 for eachi D1; 2; : : : ; m . We also\\ncreate a newsupersinkt and add a directed edge.ti ; t / with capacityc.ti ; t / D1\\nfor eachi D1; 2; : : : ; n . Intuitively, any ﬂow in the network in (a) corresponds to\\na ﬂow in the network in (b), and vice versa. The single sources simply provides\\nas much ﬂow as desired for the multiple sourcessi , and the single sinkt likewise\\nconsumes as much ﬂow as desired for the multiple sinksti . Exercise 26.1-2 asks\\nyou to prove formally that the two problems are equivalent.\\nExercises\\n26.1-1\\nShow that splitting an edge in a ﬂow network yields an equivalent network. More\\nformally, suppose that ﬂow networkG contains edge.u; \\x17/ , and we create a new\\nﬂow networkG0 by creating a new vertexx and replacing .u; \\x17/ by new edges\\n.u; x/ and .x; \\x17/ with c.u; x/ Dc.x; \\x17/ Dc.u; \\x17/ .

When no augmenting paths exist, the\\nﬂow f is a maximum ﬂow.\\nAnalysisofFord-Fulkerson\\nThe running time of FORD -FULKERSON depends on how we ﬁnd the augmenting\\npath p in line 3. If we choose it poorly, the algorithm might not even terminate: the\\nvalue of the ﬂow will increase with successive augmentations, but it need not even\\nconverge to the maximum ﬂow value.2 If we ﬁnd the augmenting path by using a\\nbreadth-ﬁrst search (which we saw in Section 22.2), however, the algorithm runs in\\npolynomial time. Before proving this result, we obtain a simple bound for the case\\nin which we choose the augmenting path arbitrarily and all capacities are integers.\\nIn practice, the maximum-ﬂow problem often arises with integral capacities. If\\nthe capacities are rational numbers, we can apply an appropriate scaling transfor-\\nmation to make them all integral. Iff \\x03 denotes a maximum ﬂow in the transformed\\nnetwork, then a straightforward implementation of FORD -FULKERSON executes\\nthe whileloop of lines 3–8 at mostjf \\x03jtimes, since the ﬂow value increases by at\\nleast one unit in each iteration.\\nWe can perform the work done within thewhileloop efﬁciently if we implement\\nthe ﬂow networkG D.V; E / with the right data structure and ﬁnd an augmenting\\npath by a linear-time algorithm.

Push-relabel methods also efﬁ-\\nciently solve other ﬂow problems, such as the minimum-cost ﬂow problem. This\\nsection introduces Goldberg’s “generic” maximum-ﬂow algorithm, which has a\\nsimple implementation that runs inO.V 2E / time, thereby improving upon the\\nO.VE 2 / bound of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm. Section 26.5 reﬁnes the generic\\nalgorithm to obtain another push-relabel algorithm that runs inO.V 3/ time.\\nPush-relabel algorithms work in a more localized manner than the Ford-\\nFulkerson method. Rather than examine the entire residual network to ﬁnd an aug-\\nmenting path, push-relabel algorithms work on one vertex at a time, looking only\\nat the vertex’s neighbors in the residual network. Furthermore, unlike the Ford-\\nFulkerson method, push-relabel algorithms do not maintain the ﬂow-conservation\\nproperty throughout their execution. They do, however, maintain apreﬂow, which\\nis a functionf WV \\x02V !R that satisﬁes the capacity constraint and the following\\nrelaxation of ﬂow conservation:X\\n\\x172V\\nf .\\x17; u/ /NUL\\nX\\n\\x172V\\nf .u; \\x17/ \\x150\\nfor all verticesu 2V /NUL fsg.

The excess at a vertex is the amount by which the\\nﬂow in exceeds the ﬂow out. We say that a vertexu 2V /NUL fs; t gis overﬂowingif\\ne.u/ > 0 .'),\n",

We shall then investigate the two operations employed by the method:\\n“pushing” preﬂow and “relabeling” a vertex. Finally, we shall present a generic\\npush-relabel algorithm and analyze its correctness and running time.\\nIntuition\\nYou can understand the intuition behind the push-relabel method in terms of ﬂuid\\nﬂows: we consider a ﬂow networkG D.V; E / to be a system of interconnected\\npipes of given capacities. Applying this analogy to the Ford-Fulkerson method,\\nwe might say that each augmenting path in the network gives rise to an additional\\nstream of ﬂuid, with no branch points, ﬂowing from the source to the sink. The\\nFord-Fulkerson method iteratively adds more streams of ﬂow until no more can be\\nadded.\\nThe generic push-relabel algorithm has a rather different intuition. As before,\\ndirected edges correspond to pipes. Vertices, which are pipe junctions, have two\\ninteresting properties. First, to accommodate excess ﬂow, each vertex has an out-\\nﬂow pipe leading to an arbitrarily large reservoir that can accumulate ﬂuid. Second,\\neach vertex, its reservoir, and all its pipe connections sit on a platform whose height\\nincreases as the algorithm progresses.\\nVertex heights determine how ﬂow is pushed: we push ﬂow only downhill, that\\nis, from a higher vertex to a lower vertex. The ﬂow from a lower vertex to a higher\\nvertex may be positive, but operations that push ﬂow push it only downhill. We\\nﬁx the height of the source atjV jand the height of the sink at0. All other vertex\\nheights start at0 and increase with time. The algorithm ﬁrst sends as much ﬂow as\\npossible downhill from the source toward the sink. The amount it sends is exactly\\nenough to ﬁll each outgoing pipe from the source to capacity; that is, it sends the\\ncapacity of the cut.s; V /NUL fsg/. When ﬂow ﬁrst enters an intermediate vertex, it\\ncollects in the vertex’s reservoir. From there, we eventually push it downhill.\\nWe may eventually ﬁnd that the only pipes that leave a vertexu and are not\\nalready saturated with ﬂow connect to vertices that are on the same level asu or\\nare uphill fromu. In this case, to rid an overﬂowing vertexu of its excess ﬂow, we\\nmust increase its height—an operation called “relabeling” vertexu. We increase\\nits height to one unit more than the height of the lowest of its neighbors to which\\nit has an unsaturated pipe. After a vertex is relabeled, therefore, it has at least one\\noutgoing pipe through which we can push more ﬂow.\\nEventually, all the ﬂow that can possibly get through to the sink has arrived there.\\nNo more can arrive, because the pipes obey the capacity constraints; the amount of\\nﬂow across any cut is still limited by the capacity of the cut. To make the preﬂow\\na “legal” ﬂow, the algorithm then sends the excess collected in the reservoirs of\\noverﬂowing vertices back to the source by continuing to relabel vertices to above'),\n",

As we shall see, once we have emptied all the\\nreservoirs, the preﬂow is not only a “legal” ﬂow, it is also a maximum ﬂow.\\nThebasicoperations\\nFrom the preceding discussion, we see that a push-relabel algorithm performs two\\nbasic operations: pushing ﬂow excess from a vertex to one of its neighbors and\\nrelabeling a vertex. The situations in which these operations apply depend on the\\nheights of vertices, which we now deﬁne precisely.\\nLet G D.V; E / be a ﬂow network with sources and sink t , and letf be a\\npreﬂow in G.

We maintain the excess ﬂow stored at a vertexu as\\nthe attributeu: e and the height ofu as the attributeu: h. The expression\\x81f .u; \\x17/\\nis a temporary variable that stores the amount of ﬂow that we can push fromu to \\x17.\\n3In the literature, a height function is typically called a “distance function,” and the height of a vertex\\nis called a “distance label.” We use the term “height” because it is more suggestive of the intuition\\nbehind the algorithm. We retain the use of the term “relabel” to refer to the operation that increases\\nthe height of a vertex. The height of a vertex is related to its distance from the sinkt , as would be\\nfound in a breadth-ﬁrst search of the transposeGT.'),\n",

Initially, ˆ D0, and the\\nvalue ofˆ may change after each relabeling, saturating push, and nonsaturating\\npush. We will bound the amount that saturating pushes and relabelings can con-\\ntribute to the increase ofˆ. Then we will show that each nonsaturating push must\\ndecrease ˆ by at least1, and will use these bounds to derive an upper bound on the\\nnumber of nonsaturating pushes.\\nLet us examine the two ways in whichˆ might increase. First, relabeling a\\nvertex u increases ˆ by less than2 jV j, since the set over which the sum is taken is\\nthe same and the relabeling cannot increaseu’s height by more than its maximum\\npossible height, which, by Lemma 26.20, is at most2 jV j/NUL 1. Second, a saturating\\npush from a vertexu to a vertex\\x17 increases ˆ by less than2 jV j, since no heights\\nchange and only vertex\\x17, whose height is at most2 jV j/NUL 1, can possibly become\\noverﬂowing.\\nNow we show that a nonsaturating push fromu to \\x17 decreases ˆ by at least1.\\nWhy? Before the nonsaturating push,u was overﬂowing, and\\x17 may or may not\\nhave been overﬂowing. By Lemma 26.13,u is no longer overﬂowing after the\\npush. In addition, unless\\x17 is the source, it may or may not be overﬂowing after\\nthe push. Therefore, the potential functionˆ has decreased by exactlyu: h, and it\\nhas increased by either0 or \\x17: h. Since u: h /NUL \\x17: h D1, the net effect is that the\\npotential function has decreased by at least1.\\nThus, during the course of the algorithm, the total amount of increase inˆ is\\ndue to relabelings and saturated pushes, and Corollary 26.21 and Lemma 26.22\\nconstrain the increase to be less than.2 jV j/.2 jV j2/ C.2 jV j/.2 jV jjE j/ D\\n4 jV j2 .jV jCjE j/. Since ˆ \\x150, the total amount of decrease, and therefore the\\ntotal number of nonsaturating pushes, is less than4 jV j2 .jV jCjE j/.\\nHaving bounded the number of relabelings, saturating pushes,and nonsaturat-\\ning pushes, we have set the stage for the following analysis of the GENERIC -\\nPUSH -RELABEL procedure, and hence of any algorithm based on the push-relabel\\nmethod.\\nTheorem26.24\\nDuring the execution of GENERIC -PUSH -RELABEL on any ﬂow networkG D\\n.V; E / , the number of basic operations isO.V 2 E /.\\nProof Immediate from Corollary 26.21 and Lemmas 26.22 and 26.23.'),\n",

If a call to\\nDISCHARGE .u/ starts with the pointeru: current at the head ofu’s neighbor list\\nand ﬁnishes with it off the end of the list, then all ofu’s outgoing edges are in-\\nadmissible and a relabel operation applies. It is possible, however, that during a\\ncall to DISCHARGE .u/, the pointeru: current traverses only part of the list be-\\nfore the procedure returns. Calls to DISCHARGE on other vertices may then oc-\\ncur, but u: current will continue moving through the list during the next call to\\nDISCHARGE .u/. We now consider what happens during a complete pass through\\nthe list, which begins at the head ofu: N and ﬁnishes withu: current DNIL . Once\\nu: current reaches the end of the list, the procedure relabelsu and begins a new\\npass. For theu: current pointer to advance past a vertex\\x17 2u: N during a pass, the\\nedge .u; \\x17/ must be deemed inadmissible by the test in line 6. Thus, by the time\\nthe pass completes, every edge leavingu has been determined to be inadmissible\\nat some time during the pass. The key observation is that at the end of the pass,\\nevery edge leavingu is still inadmissible. Why? By Lemma 26.27, pushes cannot\\ncreate any admissible edges, regardless of which vertex the ﬂow is pushed from.\\nThus, any admissible edge must be created by a relabel operation. But the vertexu\\nis not relabeled during the pass, and by Lemma 26.28, any other vertex\\x17 that is\\nrelabeled during the pass (resulting from a call of DISCHARGE .\\x17/) has no entering\\nadmissible edges after relabeling. Thus, at the end of the pass, all edges leavingu\\nremain inadmissible, which completes the proof.\\nTherelabel-to-front algorithm\\nIn the relabel-to-front algorithm, we maintain a linked listL consisting of all ver-\\ntices inV /NUL fs; t g. A key property is that the vertices inL are topologically sorted\\naccording to the admissible network, as we shall see in the loop invariant that fol-\\nlows. (Recall from Lemma 26.26 that the admissible network is a dag.)\\nThe pseudocode for the relabel-to-front algorithm assumes that the neighbor\\nlists u: N have already been created for each vertexu.

Many early implementations\\nof the Ford-Fulkerson method found augmenting paths using breadth-ﬁrst search;\\nEdmonds and Karp [102], and independently Dinic [89], proved that this strategy\\nyields a polynomial-time algorithm. A related idea, that of using “blocking ﬂows,”\\nwas also ﬁrst developed by Dinic [89]. Karzanov [202] ﬁrst developed the idea of\\npreﬂows. The push-relabel method is due to Goldberg [136] and Goldberg and Tar-\\njan [140]. Goldberg and Tarjan gave anO.V 3/-time algorithm that uses a queue to\\nmaintain the set of overﬂowing vertices, as well as an algorithm that uses dynamic\\ntrees to achieve a running time ofO.VE lg.V 2 =E C2//.

Cheriyan and Hagerup [61] suggested randomly permuting the neighbor\\nlists, and several researchers [14, 204, 276] developed clever derandomizations of\\nthis idea, leading to a sequence of faster algorithms. The algorithm of King, Rao,\\nand Tarjan [204] is the fastest such algorithm and runs inO.VE logE =.V lg V / V /\\ntime.\\nThe asymptotically fastest algorithm to date for the maximum-ﬂow problem, by\\nGoldberg and Rao [138], runs in timeO.min.V 2=3 ; E 1=2 /E lg.V 2=E C2/ lg C / ,\\nwhere C D max.u;\\x17/2E c.u; \\x17/ .

Several classic problems are proved to be NP-complete: determining\\nwhether a graph has a hamiltonian cycle, determining whether a boolean formula\\nis satisﬁable, and determining whether a given set of numbers has a subset that\\nadds up to a given target value.

Although time\\nwill tell, that is the approach we shall take in this chapter.\\nOne common means of programming chip multiprocessors and other shared-\\nmemory parallel computers is by usingstaticthreading, which provides a software\\nabstraction of “virtual processors,” orthreads, sharing a common memory. Each\\nthread maintains an associated program counter and can execute code indepen-\\ndently of the other threads. The operating system loads a thread onto a processor\\nfor execution and switches it out when another thread needs to run. Although the\\noperating system allows programmers to create and destroy threads, these opera-\\ntions are comparatively slow. Thus, for most applications, threads persist for the\\nduration of a computation, which is why we call them “static.”\\nUnfortunately, programming a shared-memory parallel computer directly using\\nstatic threads is difﬁcult and error-prone. One reason is that dynamically parti-\\ntioning the work among the threads so that each thread receives approximately\\nthe same load turns out to be a complicated undertaking. For any but the sim-\\nplest of applications, the programmer must use complex communication protocols\\nto implement a scheduler to load-balance the work. This state of affairs has led\\ntoward the creation ofconcurrency platforms, which provide a layer of software\\nthat coordinates, schedules, and manages the parallel-computing resources. Some\\nconcurrency platforms are built as runtime libraries, but others provide full-ﬂedged\\nparallel languages with compiler and runtime support.\\nDynamicmultithreadedprogramming\\nOne important class of concurrency platform isdynamicmultithreading, which is\\nthe model we shall adopt in this chapter. Dynamic multithreading allows program-\\nmers to specify parallelism in applications without worrying about communication\\nprotocols, load balancing, and other vagaries of static-thread programming. The\\nconcurrency platform contains a scheduler, which load-balances the computation\\nautomatically, thereby greatly simplifying the programmer’s chore. Although the\\nfunctionality of dynamic-multithreading environments is still evolving, almost all\\nsupport two features: nested parallelism and parallel loops. Nested parallelism\\nallows a subroutine to be “spawned,” allowing the caller to proceed while the\\nspawned subroutine is computing its result. A parallel loop is like an ordinary\\nforloop, except that the iterations of the loop can execute concurrently.\\nThese two features form the basis of the model for dynamic multithreading that\\nwe shall study in this chapter. A key aspect of this model is that the programmer\\nneeds to specify only the logical parallelism within a computation, and the threads\\nwithin the underlying concurrency platform schedule and load-balance the compu-\\ntation among themselves.

Moreover, just as serial divide-and-\\nconquer algorithms lend themselves to analysis by solving recurrences, so do\\nmultithreaded algorithms.\\n\\x0f The model is faithful to how parallel-computing practice is evolving. A grow-\\ning number of concurrency platforms support one variant or another of dynamic\\nmultithreading, including Cilk [51, 118], Cilk++ [71], OpenMP [59], Task Par-\\nallel Library [230], and Threading Building Blocks [292].\\nSection 27.1 introduces the dynamic multithreading model and presents the met-\\nrics of work, span, and parallelism, which we shall use to analyze multithreaded\\nalgorithms. Section 27.2 investigates how to multiply matrices with multithread-\\ning, and Section 27.3 tackles the tougher problem of multithreading merge sort.\\n27.1 Thebasicsofdynamicmultithreading\\nWe shall begin our exploration of dynamic multithreading using the example of\\ncomputing Fibonacci numbers recursively.

Sequential consistency means that the shared memory, which may\\nin reality be performing many loads and stores from the processors at the same\\ntime, produces the same results as if at each step, exactly one instruction from one\\nof the processors is executed. That is, the memory behaves as if the instructions\\nwere executed sequentially according to some global linear order that preserves the\\nindividual orders in which each processor issues its own instructions. For dynamic\\nmultithreaded computations, which are scheduled onto processors automatically\\nby the concurrency platform, the shared memory behaves as if the multithreaded\\ncomputation’s instructions were interleaved to produce a linear order that preserves\\nthe partial order of the computation dag. Depending on scheduling, the ordering\\ncould differ from one run of the program to another, but the behavior of any exe-\\ncution can be understood by assuming that the instructions are executed in some\\nlinear order consistent with the computation dag.\\nIn addition to making assumptions about semantics, the ideal-parallel-computer\\nmodel makes some performance assumptions.

In fact, the overhead of recursive spawning does increase the work\\nof a parallel loop compared with that of its serialization, but not asymptotically.\\nTo see why, observe that since the tree of recursive procedure instances is a full\\nbinary tree, the number of internal nodes is1 fewer than the number of leaves (see\\nExercise B.5-3). Each internal node performs constant work to divide the iteration\\nrange, and each leaf corresponds to an iteration of the loop, which takes at least\\nconstant time (‚.n/ time in this case). Thus, we can amortize the overhead of re-\\ncursive spawning against the work of the iterations, contributing at most a constant\\nfactor to the overall work.\\nAs a practical matter, dynamic-multithreading concurrency platforms sometimes\\ncoarsenthe leaves of the recursion by executing several iterations in a single leaf,\\neither automatically or under programmer control, thereby reducing the overhead\\nof recursive spawning. This reduced overhead comes at the expense of also reduc-\\ning the parallelism, however, but if the computation has sufﬁcient parallel slack-\\nness, near-perfect linear speedup need not be sacriﬁced.\\nWe must also account for the overhead of recursive spawning when analyzing the\\nspan of a parallel-loop construct.

Let’s see how this anomaly might occur.\\nWhen a processor incrementsx, the operation is not indivisible, but is composed\\nof a sequence of instructions:\\n1. Read x from memory into one of the processor’s registers.\\n2. Increment the value in the register.\\n3. Write the value in the register back intox in memory.\\nFigure 27.5(a) illustrates a computation dag representing the execution of RACE -\\nEXAMPLE , with the strands broken down to individual instructions.

Part (b) of the ﬁgure shows the values\\nin an execution of the computation that elicits the anomaly. The valuex is stored\\nin memory, andr1 and r2 are processor registers. In step 1, one of the processors\\nsets x to 0. In steps 2 and 3, processor 1 readsx from memory into its registerr1\\nand increments it, producing the value1 in r1. At that point, processor 2 comes\\ninto the picture, executing instructions 4–6. Processor 2 readsx from memory into\\nregister r2; increments it, producing the value1 in r2; and then stores this value\\ninto x, settingx to 1. Now, processor 1 resumes with step 7, storing the value1\\nin r1 into x, which leaves the value ofx unchanged. Therefore, step 8 prints the\\nvalue 1, rather than2, as the serialization would print.\\nWe can see what has happened.

Now we show how to efﬁciently compute an LUP decomposition\\nfor A. We start with the case in whichA is ann \\x02n nonsingular matrix andP is\\nabsent (or, equivalently,P DIn). In this case, we factorA DLU . We call the\\ntwo matricesL and U an LUdecomposition of A.\\nWe use a process known asGaussian eliminationto create an LU decomposi-\\ntion. We start by subtracting multiples of the ﬁrst equation from the other equations\\nin order to remove the ﬁrst variable from those equations. Then, we subtract mul-\\ntiples of the second equation from the third and subsequent equations so that now\\nthe ﬁrst and second variables are removed from them. We continue this process\\nuntil the system that remains has an upper-triangular form—in fact, it is the ma-\\ntrix U . The matrixL is made up of the row multipliers that cause variables to be\\neliminated.\\nOur algorithm to implement this strategy is recursive.

The basic idea is that for any nonsingular matrixA, the ma-\\ntrix ATA is symmetric (by Exercise D.1-2) and positive-deﬁnite (by Theorem D.6).\\nThe trick, then, is to reduce the problem of invertingA to the problem of invert-\\ning ATA.\\nThe reduction is based on the observation that whenA is ann \\x02n nonsingular\\nmatrix, we have\\nA/NUL 1 D.ATA//NUL 1AT ;\\nsince ..ATA//NUL 1AT/A D .ATA//NUL 1.ATA/ D In and a matrix inverse is unique.\\nTherefore, we can computeA/NUL 1 by ﬁrst multiplyingAT by A to obtainATA, then\\ninverting the symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrixATA using the above divide-and-\\nconquer algorithm, and ﬁnally multiplying the result byAT.

They also address\\nthe question of how to compute this value without actually computingA/NUL 1.\\nGaussian elimination, upon which the LU and LUP decompositions are based,\\nwas the ﬁrst systematic method for solving linear systems of equations. It was also\\none of the earliest numerical algorithms. Although it was known earlier, its dis-\\ncovery is commonly attributed to C. F. Gauss (1777–1855). In his famous paper\\n[325], Strassen showed that ann \\x02n matrix can be inverted inO.nlg 7/ time. Wino-\\ngrad [358] originally proved that matrix multiplication is no harder than matrix\\ninversion, and the converse is due to Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman [5].\\nAnother important matrix decomposition is thesingular value decomposition,\\nor SVD. The SVD factors anm \\x02n matrix A into A DQ1 †QT\\n2 , where† is an\\nm \\x02n matrix with nonzero values only on the diagonal,Q1 is m \\x02m with mutually\\northonormal columns, andQ2 is n \\x02n, also with mutually orthonormal columns.\\nTwo vectors areorthonormalif their inner product is0 and each vector has a norm\\nof 1. The books by Strang [323, 324] and Golub and Van Loan [144] contain good\\ntreatments of the SVD.\\nStrang [324] has an excellent presentation of symmetric positive-deﬁnite matri-\\nces and of linear algebra in general.'),\n",

Your primary issues are building more roads, gun\\ncontrol, farm subsidies, and a gasoline tax dedicated to improved public transit.\\nAccording to your campaign staff’s research, you can estimate how many votes\\nyou win or lose from each population segment by spending $1,000 on advertising\\non each issue.

Figure 29.2(b) shows the linesx1 Cx2 D0, x1 Cx2 D4,\\nand x1 Cx2 D8. Because the feasible region in Figure 29.2 is bounded, there\\nmust be some maximum value´ for which the intersection of the linex1 Cx2 D´\\nand the feasible region is nonempty. Any point at which this occurs is an optimal\\nsolution to the linear program, which in this case is the pointx1 D2 and x2 D6\\nwith objective value8.\\nIt is no accident that an optimal solution to the linear program occurs at a vertex\\nof the feasible region. The maximum value of´ for which the linex1 Cx2 D´\\nintersects the feasible region must be on the boundary of the feasible region, and\\nthus the intersection of this line with the boundary of the feasible region is either a\\nsingle vertex or a line segment. If the intersection is a single vertex, then there is\\njust one optimal solution, and it is that vertex. If the intersection is a line segment,\\nevery point on that line segment must have the same objective value; in particular,\\nboth endpoints of the line segment are optimal solutions. Since each endpoint of a\\nline segment is a vertex, there is an optimal solution at a vertex in this case as well.\\nAlthough we cannot easily graph linear programs with more than two variables,\\nthe same intuition holds. If we have three variables, then each constraint corre-\\nsponds to a half-space in three-dimensional space. The intersection of these half-\\nspaces forms the feasible region. The set of points for which the objective function\\nobtains a given value´ is now a plane (assuming no degenerate conditions). If all\\ncoefﬁcients of the objective function are nonnegative, and if the origin is a feasible\\nsolution to the linear program, then as we move this plane away from the origin, in\\na direction normal to the objective function, we ﬁnd points of increasing objective\\nvalue. (If the origin is not feasible or if some coefﬁcients in the objective function\\nare negative, the intuitive picture becomes slightly more complicated.) As in two\\ndimensions, because the feasible region is convex, the set of points that achieve\\nthe optimal objective value must include a vertex of the feasible region. Simi-\\nlarly, if we haven variables, each constraint deﬁnes a half-space inn-dimensional\\nspace. We call the feasible region formed by the intersection of these half-spaces a\\nsimplex. The objective function is now a hyperplane and, because of convexity, an\\noptimal solution still occurs at a vertex of the simplex.\\nThe simplex algorithmtakes as input a linear program and returns an optimal\\nsolution. It starts at some vertex of the simplex and performs a sequence of itera-\\ntions. In each iteration, it moves along an edge of the simplex from a current vertex\\nto a neighboring vertex whose objective value is no smaller than that of the current\\nvertex (and usually is larger.) The simplex algorithm terminates when it reaches\\na local maximum, which is a vertex from which all neighboring vertices have a\\nsmaller objective value. Because the feasible region is convex and the objective\\nfunction is linear, this local optimum is actually a global optimum. In Section 29.4,'),\n",

The airline wants to schedule\\ncrews on all of its ﬂights using as few crew members as possible.\\n\\x0f An oil company wants to decide where to drill for oil.

The company has a limited budget for\\nlocating new drills and wants to maximize the amount of oil it expects to ﬁnd,\\ngiven this budget.\\nWith linear programs, we also model and solve graph and combinatorial prob-\\nlems, such as those appearing in this textbook. We have already seen a special\\ncase of linear programming used to solve systems of difference constraints in Sec-\\ntion 24.4. In Section 29.2, we shall study how to formulate several graph and\\nnetwork-ﬂow problems as linear programs. In Section 35.4, we shall use linear\\nprogramming as a tool to ﬁnd an approximate solution to another graph problem.'),\n",

A linear\\nprogram might not be in standard form for any of four possible reasons:\\n1. The objective function might be a minimization rather than a maximization.\\n2. There might be variables without nonnegativity constraints.\\n3. There might beequality constraints, which have an equal sign rather than a\\nless-than-or-equal-to sign.\\n4. There might beinequality constraints, but instead of having a less-than-or-\\nequal-to sign, they have a greater-than-or-equal-to sign.\\nWhen converting one linear programL into another linear programL0 , we would\\nlike the property that an optimal solution toL0 yields an optimal solution toL. To\\ncapture this idea, we say that two maximization linear programsL and L0 are\\nequivalent if for each feasible solutionNx to L with objective value´, there is\\na corresponding feasible solutionNx0 to L0 with objective value´, and for each\\nfeasible solution Nx0 to L0 with objective value´, there is a corresponding feasible\\nsolution Nx to L with objective value´. (This deﬁnition does not imply a one-to-\\none correspondence between feasible solutions.) A minimization linear programL\\nand a maximization linear programL0 are equivalent if for each feasible solutionNx\\nto L with objective value´, there is a corresponding feasible solutionNx0 to L0 with\\nobjective value/NUL´, and for each feasible solutionNx0 to L0 with objective value´,\\nthere is a corresponding feasible solutionNx to L with objective value/NUL´.\\nWe now show how to remove, one by one, each of the possible problems in the\\nlist above. After removing each one, we shall argue that the new linear program is\\nequivalent to the old one.\\nTo convert a minimization linear programL into an equivalent maximization lin-\\near programL0 , we simply negate the coefﬁcients in the objective function. Since\\nL and L0 have identical sets of feasible solutions and, for any feasible solution, the\\nobjective value inL is the negative of the objective value inL0, these two linear\\nprograms are equivalent.

Then, we replace each occurrence ofxj by x0\\nj /NUL x00\\nj , and add the non-\\nnegativity constraintsx0\\nj \\x150 and x00\\nj \\x150.

Any feasible solutionyx to the new linear program cor-\\nresponds to a feasible solutionNx to the original linear program withNxj Dyx0\\nj /NULyx00\\nj\\nand with the same objective value. Also, any feasible solutionNx to the original\\nlinear program corresponds to a feasible solutionyx to the new linear program with\\nyx0\\nj DNxj and yx00\\nj D0 if Nxj \\x150, or withyx00\\nj D/NULNxj and yx0\\nj D0 if Nxj < 0 . The two\\nlinear programs have the same objective value regardless of the sign ofNxj . Thus,\\nthe two linear programs are equivalent.

Although the minimum-cost-\\nﬂow problem has a polynomial-time algorithm that is not based on linear program-\\nming, we won’t describe the algorithm. Finally, we describe the multicommodity-\\nﬂow problem, for which the only known polynomial-time algorithm is based on\\nlinear programming.\\nWhen we solved graph problems in Part VI, we used attribute notation, such\\nas \\x17: d and .u; \\x17/: f .

An iteration\\nconverts one slack form into an equivalent slack form. The objective value of the\\nassociated basic feasible solution will be no less than that at the previous iteration,\\nand usually greater. To achieve this increase in the objective value, we choose a\\nnonbasic variable such that if we were to increase that variable’s value from0, then\\nthe objective value would increase, too. The amount by which we can increase\\nthe variable is limited by the other constraints. In particular, we raise it until some\\nbasic variable becomes0. We then rewrite the slack form, exchanging the roles\\nof that basic variable and the chosen nonbasic variable. Although we have used a\\nparticular setting of the variables to guide the algorithm, and we shall use it in our\\nproofs, the algorithm does not explicitly maintain this solution. It simply rewrites\\nthe linear program until an optimal solution becomes “obvious.”\\nAnexampleofthesimplexalgorithm\\nWe begin with an extended example. Consider the following linear program in\\nstandard form:\\nmaximize 3x1 C x2 C 2x3 (29.53)\\nsubject to\\nx1 C x2 C 3x3 \\x14 30 (29.54)\\n2x1 C 2x2 C 5x3 \\x14 24 (29.55)\\n4x1 C x2 C 2x3 \\x14 36 (29.56)\\nx1; x 2 ; x 3 \\x15 0 : (29.57)\\nIn order to use the simplex algorithm, we must convert the linear program into\\nslack form; we saw how to do so in Section 29.1. In addition to being an algebraic\\nmanipulation, slack is a useful algorithmic concept. Recalling from Section 29.1\\nthat each variable has a corresponding nonnegativity constraint, we say that an\\nequality constraint istight for a particular setting of its nonbasic variables if they\\ncause the constraint’s basic variable to become0. Similarly, a setting of the non-\\nbasic variables that would make a basic variable become negativeviolates that\\nconstraint. Thus, the slack variables explicitly maintain how far each constraint is\\nfrom being tight, and so they help to determine how much we can increase values\\nof nonbasic variables without violating any constraints.\\nAssociating the slack variablesx4, x5, andx6 with inequalities (29.54)–(29.56),\\nrespectively, and putting the linear program into slack form, we obtain'),\n",

A solution is\\nfeasible if all ofx1; x 2 ; : : : ; x 6 are nonnegative, and there can be an inﬁnite num-\\nber of feasible solutions as well. The inﬁnite number of possible solutions to a\\nsystem such as this one will be useful in later proofs. We focus on thebasic solu-\\ntion: set all the (nonbasic) variables on the right-hand side to0 and then compute\\nthe values of the (basic) variables on the left-hand side. In this example, the ba-\\nsic solution is. Nx1; Nx2 ; : : : ; Nx6/ D .0; 0; 0; 30; 24; 36/ and it has objective value\\n´ D.3 \\x010/ C.1 \\x010/ C.2 \\x010/ D0. Observe that this basic solution setsNxi Dbi\\nfor eachi 2B . An iteration of the simplex algorithm rewrites the set of equations\\nand the objective function so as to put a different set of variables on the right-\\nhand side. Thus, a different basic solution is associated with the rewritten problem.\\nWe emphasize that the rewrite does not in any way change the underlying linear-\\nprogramming problem; the problem at one iteration has the identical set of feasible\\nsolutions as the problem at the previous iteration. The problem does, however,\\nhave a different basic solution than that of the previous iteration.\\nIf a basic solution is also feasible, we call it abasicfeasiblesolution . As we run\\nthe simplex algorithm, the basic solution is almost always a basic feasible solution.\\nWe shall see in Section 29.5, however, that for the ﬁrst few iterations of the simplex\\nalgorithm, the basic solution might not be feasible.\\nOur goal, in each iteration, is to reformulate the linear program so that the basic\\nsolution has a greater objective value. We select a nonbasic variablexe whose\\ncoefﬁcient in the objective function is positive, and we increase the value ofxe as\\nmuch as possible without violating any of the constraints. The variablexe becomes\\nbasic, and some other variablexl becomes nonbasic. The values of other basic\\nvariables and of the objective function may also change.\\nTo continue the example, let’s think about increasing the value ofx1. As we\\nincrease x1, the values ofx4, x5, andx6 all decrease. Because we have a nonnega-\\ntivity constraint for each variable, we cannot allow any of them to become negative.\\nIf x1 increases above30, thenx4 becomes negative, andx5 and x6 become nega-\\ntive whenx1 increases above12 and 9, respectively. The third constraint (29.61) is\\nthe tightest constraint, and it limits how much we can increasex1. Therefore, we\\nswitch the roles ofx1 and x6. We solve equation (29.61) forx1 and obtain\\nx1 D9 /NUL x2\\n4 /NUL x3\\n2 /NUL x6\\n4 : (29.62)'),\n",

We perform two operations\\nin the simplex algorithm: rewrite equations so that variables move between the left-\\nhand side and the right-hand side, and substitute one equation into another. The ﬁrst\\noperation trivially creates an equivalent problem, and the second, by elementary\\nlinear algebra, also creates an equivalent problem. (See Exercise 29.3-3.)\\nTo demonstrate this equivalence, observe that our original basic solution.0; 0;\\n0; 30; 24; 36/ satisﬁes the new equations (29.65)–(29.67) and has objective value\\n27 C.1=4/ \\x010 C.1=2/ \\x010 /NUL .3=4/ \\x0136 D0.

How\\nfar can we increasex3 without violating any of the constraints? Constraint (29.65)\\nlimits it to18, constraint (29.66) limits it to42=5, and constraint (29.67) limits\\nit to3=2.

Now that we have a slack form for which\\nthe basic solution is feasible, we can, in line 10, repeatedly call PIVOT to fully\\nsolve the auxiliary linear program. As the test in line 11 demonstrates, if we ﬁnd\\nan optimal solution toLaux with objective value0, then in lines 12–14, we create\\na slack form forL for which the basic solution is feasible.

Dantzig\\nin 1947. Shortly after, researchers discovered how to formulate a number of prob-\\nlems in a variety of ﬁelds as linear programs and solve them with the simplex\\nalgorithm. As a result, applications of linear programming ﬂourished, along with\\nseveral algorithms. Variants of the simplex algorithm remain the most popular\\nmethods for solving linear-programming problems. This history appears in a num-\\nber of places, including the notes in [69] and [197].\\nThe ellipsoid algorithm was the ﬁrst polynomial-time algorithm for linear pro-\\ngramming and is due to L. G. Khachian in 1979; it was based on earlier work by\\nN. Z. Shor, D. B. Judin, and A. S. Nemirovskii. Gr¨ otschel, Lov´ asz, and Schrijver\\n[154] describe how to use the ellipsoid algorithm to solve a variety of problems in\\ncombinatorial optimization. To date, the ellipsoid algorithm does not appear to be\\ncompetitive with the simplex algorithm in practice.\\nKarmarkar’s paper [198] includes a description of the ﬁrst interior-point algo-\\nrithm. Many subsequent researchers designed interior-point algorithms. Good sur-\\nveys appear in the article of Goldfarb and Todd [141] and the book by Ye [361].\\nAnalysis of the simplex algorithm remains an active area of research. V . Klee\\nand G. J. Minty constructed an example on which the simplex algorithm runs\\nthrough 2n /NUL 1 iterations. The simplex algorithm usually performs very well in\\npractice and many researchers have tried to give theoretical justiﬁcation for this\\nempirical observation. A line of research begun by K. H. Borgwardt, and carried\\non by many others, shows that under certain probabilistic assumptions on the in-\\nput, the simplex algorithm converges in expected polynomial time. Spielman and\\nTeng [322] made progress in this area, introducing the “smoothed analysis of algo-\\nrithms” and applying it to the simplex algorithm.\\nThe simplex algorithm is known to run efﬁciently in certain special cases. Par-\\nticularly noteworthy is the network-simplex algorithm, which is the simplex al-\\ngorithm, specialized to network-ﬂow problems. For certain network problems,\\nincluding the shortest-paths, maximum-ﬂow, and minimum-cost-ﬂow problems,\\nvariants of the network-simplex algorithm run in polynomial time.

The straightforward method for multiply-\\ning polynomials—equations (30.1) and (30.2)—takes‚.n2/ time when we repre-\\nsent polynomials in coefﬁcient form, but only‚.n/ time when we represent them\\nin point-value form. We can, however, multiply polynomials using the coefﬁcient\\nrepresentation in only‚.n lg n/ time by converting between the two representa-\\ntions. To see why this approach works, we must ﬁrst study complex roots of unity,\\nwhich we do in Section 30.2. Then, we use the FFT and its inverse, also described\\nin Section 30.2, to perform the conversions. Section 30.3 shows how to implement\\nthe FFT quickly in both serial and parallel models.\\nThis chapter uses complex numbers extensively, and within this chapter we use\\nthe symboli exclusively to denote\\np\\n/NUL1.\\n30.1 Representing polynomials\\nThe coefﬁcient and point-value representations of polynomials are in a sense equiv-\\nalent; that is, a polynomial in point-value form has a unique counterpart in co-\\nefﬁcient form.

We use induction onk. For the base case,k D2, and the call\\nEUCLID .F3; F 2 / makes exactly one recursive call, to EUCLID .1; 0/ .

Let the inte-\\nger n be factored asn Dn1 n2 \\x01\\x01\\x01nk , where the factorsni are pairwise relatively\\nprime.

Section 31.8 describes an efﬁcient procedure for ﬁnding\\nlarge prime numbers, and Section 31.9 discusses the problem of factoring large\\nintegers.\\nPublic-keycryptosystems\\nIn a public-key cryptosystem, each participant has both apublic keyand asecret\\nkey. Each key is a piece of information. For example, in the RSA cryptosystem,\\neach key consists of a pair of integers. The participants “Alice” and “Bob” are\\ntraditionally used in cryptography examples; we denote their public and secret\\nkeys asPA, SA for Alice andPB , SB for Bob.\\nEach participant creates his or her own public and secret keys. Secret keys are\\nkept secret, but public keys can be revealed to anyone or even published. In fact,\\nit is often convenient to assume that everyone’s public key is available in a pub-\\nlic directory, so that any participant can easily obtain the public key of any other\\nparticipant.\\nThe public and secret keys specify functions that can be applied to any message.\\nLet D denote the set of permissible messages. For example,D might be the set of\\nall ﬁnite-length bit sequences. In the simplest, and original, formulation of public-\\nkey cryptography, we require that the public and secret keys specify one-to-one\\nfunctions fromD to itself. We denote the function corresponding to Alice’s public\\nkey PA by PA./ and the function corresponding to her secret keySA by SA./. The\\nfunctions PA./ and SA./ are thus permutations ofD . We assume that the functions\\nPA./ and SA./ are efﬁciently computable given the corresponding keyPA or SA.\\nThe public and secret keys for any participant are a “matched pair” in that they\\nspecify functions that are inverses of each other. That is,\\nM D SA.PA.M // ; (31.35)\\nM D PA.SA.M // (31.36)\\nfor any messageM 2D . TransformingM with the two keysPA and SA succes-\\nsively, in either order, yields the messageM back.\\nIn a public-key cryptosystem, we require that no one but Alice be able to com-\\npute the functionSA./ in any practical amount of time. This assumption is crucial\\nto keeping encrypted mail sent to Alice private and to knowing that Alice’s digi-\\ntal signatures are authentic. Alice must keepSA secret; if she does not, she loses\\nher uniqueness and the cryptosystem cannot provide her with unique capabilities.\\nThe assumption that only Alice can computeSA./ must hold even though everyone'),\n",

At the time of this\\nwriting (2009), RSA moduli were commonly in the range of 768 to 2048 bits.\\nTo create moduli of such sizes, we must be able to ﬁnd large primes efﬁciently.\\nSection 31.8 addresses this problem.\\nFor efﬁciency, RSA is often used in a “hybrid” or “key-management” mode\\nwith fast non-public-key cryptosystems. With such a system, the encryption and\\ndecryption keys are identical. If Alice wishes to send a long messageM to Bob\\nprivately, she selects a random keyK for the fast non-public-key cryptosystem and\\nencrypts M using K, obtaining ciphertextC . Here, C is as long asM , but K\\nis quite short. Then, she encryptsK using Bob’s public RSA key. SinceK is\\nshort, computingPB .K / is fast (much faster than computingPB .M / ). She then\\ntransmits .C; P B .K // to Bob, who decryptsPB .K / to obtainK and then usesK\\nto decryptC , obtainingM .\\nWe can use a similar hybrid approach to make digital signatures efﬁciently.\\nThis approach combines RSA with a publiccollision-resistanthashfunction h—a\\nfunction that is easy to compute but for which it is computationally infeasible to\\nﬁnd two messagesM and M 0 such that h.M / D h.M 0/. The value h.M / is\\na short (say, 256-bit) “ﬁngerprint” of the messageM . If Alice wishes to sign a\\nmessage M , she ﬁrst appliesh to M to obtain the ﬁngerprinth.M / , which she\\nthen encrypts with her secret key. She sends.M; SA .h.M /// to Bob as her signed\\nversion of M . Bob can verify the signature by computingh.M / and verifying\\nthat PA applied toSA.h.M // as received equalsh.M / . Because no one can create\\ntwo messages with the same ﬁngerprint, it is computationally infeasible to alter a\\nsigned message and preserve the validity of the signature.\\nFinally, we note that the use ofcertiﬁcatesmakes distributing public keys much\\neasier. For example, assume there is a “trusted authority”T whose public key\\nis known by everyone. Alice can obtain fromT a signed message (her certiﬁcate)\\nstating that “Alice’s public key isPA.” This certiﬁcate is “self-authenticating” since\\neveryone knowsPT . Alice can include her certiﬁcate with her signed messages,\\nso that the recipient has Alice’s public key immediately available in order to verify\\nher signature. Because her key was signed byT , the recipient knows that Alice’s\\nkey is really Alice’s.\\nExercises\\n31.7-1\\nConsider an RSA key set withp D11, q D29, n D319, and e D3.

By the prime number\\ntheorem, the probability of a success—that is, the probability thatn is prime—is\\napproximately 1= ln n. The geometric distribution tells us how many trials we need\\nto obtain a success, and by equation (C.32), the expected number of trials is ap-\\nproximately lnn.

(Of\\ncourse, we can cut this ﬁgure in half by choosing only odd integers.)\\nIn the remainder of this section, we consider the problem of determining whether\\nor not a large odd integern is prime.

A common misconception is that one token equals one word, but this is not always the case.\\n\\nA token can be:\\n\\nA full word (e.g., \"apple\", \"run\")\\n\\nA part of a word (e.g., \"token\", \"iza\", \"tion\" for the word \"tokenization\")\\n\\nPunctuation (e.g., \".\", \"!\", \"?\")\\n\\nA space (e.g., \" \")\\n\\nA special marker (e.g., [CLS] for \"classification\" or [EOS] for \"end of sentence\")\\n\\nThe process of converting a plain text string (like \"Hello, world!\") into a sequence of tokens is called tokenization. Models use a specific \"tokenizer\" with a fixed vocabulary. This is why the word \"unbelievable\" might be split into \"un\", \"believe\", and \"able\". This approach allows the model to handle a vast vocabulary and even words it has never seen before by breaking them down into known sub-word parts.\\n\\nHow AI Models Generate Output\\nAn AI model like a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) is a generative model. This means it doesn\\'t plan its entire response in advance. Instead, it generates the output one token at a time.\\n\\nThe process works like this:\\n\\nInput: The model receives an input prompt (e.g., \"The capital of France is\").\\n\\nTokenization: The prompt is tokenized into a sequence of numbers, each representing a token.\\n\\nPrediction: The model analyzes the input tokens and predicts a probability distribution over its entire vocabulary for what the very next token should be. For our example, the token for \"Paris\" would receive a very high probability.\\n\\nSampling: The model selects the next token from this probability list. (This selection can be influenced by parameters like \"temperature\" and \"top_p\", which control the randomness).\\n\\nAppend and Repeat: The newly chosen token (\"Paris\") is appended to the input sequence. The model now treats \"The capital of France is Paris\" as its new input and repeats the process, predicting the next token (which might be a period \".\" or a newline character).\\n\\nThis \"predict-append-repeat\" loop continues, with the model generating one new token based on all the tokens that came before it.\\n\\nHow the Model \"Determines\" When to Stop\\nThis is the key to your question. The model doesn\\'t \"know\" it will generate 15 tokens or 100 tokens. It \"determines\" the output is finished when it decides to generate a special stop token.\\n\\nStop Tokens (or \"End-of-Sequence\" Tokens): During its training, the model learns from vast amounts of text. It learns that sentences and documents have an end. To represent this, a special token (often written as [EOS], [STOP], or <|endoftext|>) is included in its vocabulary.\\n\\nPredicting the Stop Token: In the \"predict-append-repeat\" loop, this special [EOS] token is always one of the possible tokens the model can choose. When the model determines, based on the context it has generated so far, that the thought is complete or the answer is finished, it will assign the highest probability to this [EOS] token.\\n\\nTermination: When the model generates the [EOS] token, the generation process stops. The model has \"decided\" that the output is complete. The final token count is simply the number of tokens it generated before it produced the stop token.\\n\\nExternal Control: The max_tokens Parameter\\nThere is a second, more direct way the output length is \"determined,\" but it is an external command, not a decision by the model itself.\\n\\nWhen you make a request to an AI model via an API or a user interface, you can almost always set a parameter like max_tokens or max_length.\\n\\nWhat it is: This is a hard limit you impose on the output. You are telling the model, \"Do not generate more than this many tokens, no matter what.\"\\n\\nHow it works: The model will continue its \"predict-append-repeat\" loop. If it generates the [EOS] stop token before hitting the max_tokens limit, the output will be complete and coherent.\\n\\nForced Cutoff: If the model reaches the max_tokens limit (e.g., 200 tokens) but has not yet generated a stop token, the generation is forcibly cut off. This often results in an incomplete sentence or a thought that is cut off mid-stream.\\n\\nIn summary: The AI model itself determines the end of its output by predicting a special stop token. The user or developer controls the maximum possible length by setting a max_tokens parameter to prevent runaway generation and manage costs.')]\n",

      "files/Ray Tracing.txt [Document(metadata={'source': 'files/Ray Tracing.txt', 'source_file': 'Ray Tracing.txt', 'file_type': 'txt'}, page_content='The Principles and Applications of Ray Tracing\\nWhat is Ray Tracing?\\nRay tracing is a sophisticated rendering technique used in 3D computer graphics to generate photorealistic images. It works by simulating the physical behavior of light. Unlike other rendering methods, such as rasterization, which projects 3D objects onto a 2D screen, ray tracing follows the path of light \"in reverse.\"\\n\\nInstead of simulating infinite rays of light emanating from a light source (which would be computationally impossible), ray tracing traces rays from the camera\\'s viewpoint, through each pixel on the screen, and out into the 3D scene. The color of each pixel is then determined by the objects and light sources that this \"view ray\" interacts with.\\n\\nHow Does Ray Tracing Work? The Core Algorithm\\nThe ray tracing algorithm can be broken down into several key steps for each pixel in the final image:\\n\\n1. Primary Ray Generation (Ray Casting): The process begins at the virtual camera or \"eye.\" For every pixel on the 2D image plane (the \"screen\"), a primary ray is cast from the camera\\'s position, through that pixel\\'s center, and into the 3D scene.\\n\\n2. Ray-Object Intersection: The algorithm then calculates if this primary ray intersects with any objects (like spheres, polygons, or triangles) in the scene. It finds the closest intersection point to the camera. If the ray does not hit any object, the pixel is typically colored with a background color or environment map.\\n\\n3. Shading and Illumination: If the ray hits an object, the color of that object at the intersection point must be calculated. This is where the simulation becomes recursive and powerful. To determine the color, new rays are generated from the intersection point:\\n\\nShadow Rays: A ray is cast from the intersection point toward each light source in the scene. If this \"shadow ray\" hits another object before it reaches the light source, it means the point is in shadow, and the light from that source does not contribute to its color. If the ray reaches the light source unobstructed, the light\\'s contribution (color, intensity, and angle) is factored into the pixel\\'s final color.\\n\\nReflection Rays: If the object\\'s material is reflective (like a mirror or polished metal), a new reflection ray is generated. This ray bounces off the surface at an angle equal to the angle of incidence, following the law of reflection. The algorithm then recursively traces this new ray to see what it hits. The color returned from the reflection ray is blended with the object\\'s own color.\\n\\nRefraction (Transparency) Rays: If the object\\'s material is transparent or translucent (like glass or water), a new refraction ray is generated. This ray passes through the object, bending according to Snell\\'s law, which describes the change in direction based on the material\\'s refractive index. This ray is also traced recursively to see what is visible through the object.\\n\\n4. Recursive Combination: The final color of the pixel is a combination of the object\\'s inherent color (its \"local\" illumination from light sources) and the colors gathered from its reflection and refraction rays. This recursive process can continue for a set number of \"bounces\" to simulate complex light paths, such as seeing a reflection of a reflection.\\n\\nKey Advantages of Ray Tracing\\nThe primary advantage of ray tracing is its photorealism. Because it simulates the physics of light, it can naturally and accurately produce a wide range of complex visual effects that are very difficult or impossible to achieve with other methods like rasterization.\\n\\nThese effects include:\\n\\nAccurate, Hard and Soft Shadows: Shadows are a natural byproduct of shadow rays being blocked, and they can be \"soft\" if the light source is an area rather than a single point.\\n\\nRealistic Reflections: Surfaces can show perfect mirror-like reflections or blurred/glossy reflections based on material properties.\\n\\nTrue Refraction: The bending of light as it passes through transparent objects like glass and water is simulated correctly, leading to realistic distortion effects.\\n\\nGlobal Illumination: Advanced forms of ray tracing, like path tracing, can simulate global illumination. This is where light bounces off all surfaces, not just from direct light sources. For example, sunlight hitting a red wall will cast a faint red glow onto an adjacent white ceiling.\\n\\nDisadvantages and Challenges\\nThe main drawback of ray tracing has historically been its computational cost. Tracing millions of rays (one for each pixel) and then recursively tracing shadow, reflection, and refraction rays for multiple bounces is extremely demanding on the CPU or GPU.\\n\\nFor decades, this cost restricted ray tracing to non-real-time applications, such as in visual effects (VFX) for movies and architectural visualization, where a single frame could take minutes or even hours to render.\\n\\nHowever, the advent of specialized hardware (like NVIDIA\\'s RTX GPUs with \"RT Cores\" and similar technologies from AMD and Apple) has made real-time ray tracing possible. This technology is now a major feature in modern video games, blending ray tracing with traditional rasterization to achieve realistic lighting and reflections without sacrificing performance.\\n\\nCommon Applications\\nRay tracing is used in any field that requires the highest degree of visual fidelity:\\n\\nFilm and Television (VFX): Used to create lifelike computer-generated imagery (CGI) and special effects that blend seamlessly with live-action footage.\\n\\nVideo Games: Used for realistic in-game lighting, shadows, and reflections to create more immersive environments.\\n\\nArchitecture and Product Design: Used to create photorealistic visualizations of buildings and products before they are built, allowing designers and clients to see exactly how they will look.\\n\\nScientific and Medical Visualization: Used to render complex 3D data from sources like CT or MRI scans.')]\n",

      "content='Programming in computers is the process of **creating instructions that tell a computer what to do**. These instructions are written in a **programming language**, which is a set of rules and syntax that humans can understand and that computers can translate into machine code they can execute.\\n\\nThink of it like giving a recipe to a chef. The recipe is the program, the ingredients are the data, and the chef is the computer. The chef follows the instructions precisely to create the final dish.\\n\\nHere\\'s a breakdown of key aspects of programming in computers:\\n\\n**1. What is a Program?**\\n\\n*   A program is a sequence of instructions designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks.\\n*   These tasks can range from simple calculations to complex operations like running an operating system, browsing the web, playing games, or controlling robots.\\n\\n**2. Programming Languages:**\\n\\n*   **High-Level Languages:** These are closer to human language and are easier to read and write. They abstract away many of the low-level details of the computer\\'s hardware. Examples include:\\n    *   **Python:** Known for its readability and versatility, used in web development, data science, AI, and scripting.\\n    *   **Java:** Widely used for enterprise applications, Android development, and large-scale systems.\\n    *   **C++:** Powerful and efficient, used in game development, operating systems, and performance-critical applications.\\n    *   **JavaScript:** Essential for front-end web development and increasingly used for back-end development (Node.js).\\n    *   **C#:** Popular for Windows development, game development (Unity), and enterprise applications.\\n*   **Low-Level Languages:** These are closer to the computer\\'s hardware and require a deeper understanding of how the machine works.\\n    *   **Assembly Language:** A symbolic representation of machine code, still used for specific tasks like device drivers or embedded systems.\\n    *   **Machine Code:** The raw binary instructions that the CPU directly understands. Humans rarely program directly in machine code.\\n\\n**3. The Programming Process:**\\n\\n*   **Problem Definition:** Clearly understanding what you want the computer to do.\\n*   **Algorithm Design:** Creating a step-by-step plan (algorithm) to solve the problem. This is like outlining the recipe before writing it down.\\n*   **Coding (Writing the Program):** Translating the algorithm into a specific programming language using its syntax and rules.\\n*   **Compilation/Interpretation:**\\n    *   **Compilers:** Translate the entire program into machine code before execution. This often results in faster execution. (e.g., C++, Java)\\n    *   **Interpreters:** Translate and execute the program line by line. This allows for faster development cycles and easier debugging. (e.g., Python, JavaScript)\\n*   **Testing and Debugging:** Running the program to find and fix errors (bugs). This is a crucial and often time-consuming part of the process.\\n*   **Deployment:** Making the program available for users to run.\\n*   **Maintenance:** Updating and improving the program over time.\\n\\n**4. Key Concepts in Programming:**\\n\\n*   **Variables:** Named storage locations for data (numbers, text, etc.).\\n*   **Data Types:** The kind of data a variable can hold (e.g., integer, float, string, boolean).\\n*   **Operators:** Symbols that perform operations on data (e.g., `+` for addition, `-` for subtraction, `==` for comparison).\\n*   **Control Flow:** Structures that determine the order in which instructions are executed:\\n    *   **Sequential:** Instructions are executed one after another.\\n    *   **Conditional Statements (if/else):** Executing different code blocks based on certain conditions.\\n    *   **Loops (for/while):** Repeating a block of code multiple times.\\n*   **Functions/Methods:** Reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. This promotes modularity and avoids repetition.\\n*   **Data Structures:** Ways of organizing and storing data efficiently (e.g., arrays, lists, dictionaries, trees).\\n*   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** A paradigm that organizes code around \"objects\" which have data (attributes) and behavior (methods). This promotes reusability and maintainability.\\n*   **Algorithms:** A set of well-defined instructions to solve a problem.\\n\\n**5. Why is Programming Important?**\\n\\n*   **Automation:** Automating repetitive tasks, saving time and effort.\\n*   **Problem Solving:** Developing solutions to complex challenges in various fields.\\n*   **Innovation:** Creating new technologies, applications, and experiences.\\n*   **Understanding Technology:** Gaining a deeper insight into how the digital world works.\\n*   **Career Opportunities:** A high demand for skilled programmers in a wide range of industries.\\n\\n**In essence, programming is the bridge between human ideas and computer execution.** It\\'s a creative and logical process that allows us to harness the power of computers to achieve our goals.
