Understanding Tokens and How AI Models Determine Output Length
What is a Token?
In the context of Large Language Models (LLMs), a token is the fundamental unit of text that the model processes. A common misconception is that one token equals one word, but this is not always the case.

A token can be:

A full word (e.g., "apple", "run")

A part of a word (e.g., "token", "iza", "tion" for the word "tokenization")

Punctuation (e.g., ".", "!", "?")

A space (e.g., " ")

A special marker (e.g., [CLS] for "classification" or [EOS] for "end of sentence")

The process of converting a plain text string (like "Hello, world!") into a sequence of tokens is called tokenization. Models use a specific "tokenizer" with a fixed vocabulary. This is why the word "unbelievable" might be split into "un", "believe", and "able". This approach allows the model to handle a vast vocabulary and even words it has never seen before by breaking them down into known sub-word parts.

How AI Models Generate Output
An AI model like a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) is a generative model. This means it doesn't plan its entire response in advance. Instead, it generates the output one token at a time.

The process works like this:

Input: The model receives an input prompt (e.g., "The capital of France is").

Tokenization: The prompt is tokenized into a sequence of numbers, each representing a token.

Prediction: The model analyzes the input tokens and predicts a probability distribution over its entire vocabulary for what the very next token should be. For our example, the token for "Paris" would receive a very high probability.

Sampling: The model selects the next token from this probability list. (This selection can be influenced by parameters like "temperature" and "top_p", which control the randomness).

Append and Repeat: The newly chosen token ("Paris") is appended to the input sequence. The model now treats "The capital of France is Paris" as its new input and repeats the process, predicting the next token (which might be a period "." or a newline character).

This "predict-append-repeat" loop continues, with the model generating one new token based on all the tokens that came before it.

How the Model "Determines" When to Stop
This is the key to your question. The model doesn't "know" it will generate 15 tokens or 100 tokens. It "determines" the output is finished when it decides to generate a special stop token.

Stop Tokens (or "End-of-Sequence" Tokens): During its training, the model learns from vast amounts of text. It learns that sentences and documents have an end. To represent this, a special token (often written as [EOS], [STOP], or <|endoftext|>) is included in its vocabulary.

Predicting the Stop Token: In the "predict-append-repeat" loop, this special [EOS] token is always one of the possible tokens the model can choose. When the model determines, based on the context it has generated so far, that the thought is complete or the answer is finished, it will assign the highest probability to this [EOS] token.

Termination: When the model generates the [EOS] token, the generation process stops. The model has "decided" that the output is complete. The final token count is simply the number of tokens it generated before it produced the stop token.

External Control: The max_tokens Parameter
There is a second, more direct way the output length is "determined," but it is an external command, not a decision by the model itself.

When you make a request to an AI model via an API or a user interface, you can almost always set a parameter like max_tokens or max_length.

What it is: This is a hard limit you impose on the output. You are telling the model, "Do not generate more than this many tokens, no matter what."

How it works: The model will continue its "predict-append-repeat" loop. If it generates the [EOS] stop token before hitting the max_tokens limit, the output will be complete and coherent.

Forced Cutoff: If the model reaches the max_tokens limit (e.g., 200 tokens) but has not yet generated a stop token, the generation is forcibly cut off. This often results in an incomplete sentence or a thought that is cut off mid-stream.

In summary: The AI model itself determines the end of its output by predicting a special stop token. The user or developer controls the maximum possible length by setting a max_tokens parameter to prevent runaway generation and manage costs.
